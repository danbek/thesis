\section{Cryostat Design}\label{s-cryo-design}

The cryostat for the \Imager\ was designed with the goals of simplicity, reliability and turn-key automated operation.
Highly reliable and easy-to-use cryogen-free mechanical cryocoolers are commercially available, but these cryocoolers are seldom capable of reaching temperatures below 2.5~K.
Reaching sub-Kelvin temperatures requires a second refrigeration stage, which in our case is a He-4 sorption refrigerator.
The He-4 sorption refrigerator is based on a proven design and its use can easily be automated.
Three temperature stages within the cryostat are provided in order to provide intercepts for heatsinking wiring and other objects that are thermal connected to room temperature. 
The result is a reliable cryogen-free cryogenic system that can be controlled remotely.

xxx next para needs rewriting - need to explain what PTC is early on. maybe next para needs to move here, somewhat rewritten.

The cryostat itself was built by Precision Cryogenics\footnote{Precision Cryogenics Systems, Inc. Indianapolis, IN. \url{http://www.precisioncryo.com}} to designs provided by the \Imager\ team.
\figref{fig:cryo-cutaway} shows a cutaway view of the cryostat, and \tableref{tab:temp-optical-load} lists the temperatures typically reached by different parts of the cryostat during operation when the cryostat is open optically.
The cryostat has two main parts: a cylinder containing both the PTC and the \He4-sorption refrigerator, and a box located at the bottom of the cylinder which contains temperature intercept plates and the focal plane.
There are three temperature stages, the ``90~K'' Cold Plate, the ``4~K'' Cold Plate, and the Focal Plane.
The PTC 1st stage is connected to the ``90~K'' Cold Plate by a tube of Al 1100 and a set of CDA-101 Cu braids.
The combination of this long thermal path with the high heat load on the optical filters sunk to the ``90~K'' stage explains the 45~K temperature differential between the ``90~K`` cold plate and the PTC 1st stage.
The PTC 2nd stage is connected to the ``4 K'' Cold Plate by a large (3.0 in diameter by 2.78 in long) cylinder of CDA-110 Cu\footnote{This cryostat was originally designed to work with a different cryocooler. The PTC currently installed had a shorter distance between the 1st and 2nd stages, necessitating the Cu cylinder to take up this extra space}, followed by tube of alloy CDA-101 Cu followed by a set of  CDA-101 copper braids.
The Cu tube is broken into two halves, and the condensation plate (see below) of the sorption fridge is clamped between these two halves. The ``90 K'' Cold Plate is stood off from the cryostat vacuum jacket by four ``roll wrapped'' carbon fiber tube standoffs. The ``4~K'' Cold Plate stands off from the ``90 K'' Cold Plate by eight supports made of G-10.

The first two temperature intercept stages are provided by a Cryomech PT407 Pulse Tube Cryorefrigerator\footnote{Cryomech, Inc. Syracure, NY. \url{http://www.cryomech.com}}
The PT407 has two cooling stages.
The first stage has 25~W of cooling power at 55~K while the second stage has 0.7~W at 4.2 K.
Our PT407 uses a remote motor, so that the cold head attached to the cryostat has no moving parts, minimizing vibration of the cryostat.
Vibration of the cryostat can lead to microphonic pickup either directly in the detectors themselves or in the readout circuitry, leading to much higher detector noise.

Options for reaching temperatures below the $\sim$1.2~K transition temperature of our \TES\ detectors include: dilution refrigerators, adiabatic magnetization refrigerators, pumped \He4 baths, and \He3- and/or \He4-sorption refrigerators.
We chose a \He4-sorption fridge because of its low cost, ease of operation compared to other solutions, and the fact that the typical base temperatures under no load of $\sim$700~mK is well-matched to our application. xxx actually the key point is temperature - others are in addition.
A  \He4-sorption fridge works by using a charcoal adsorber to pump on a bath of liquid \He4, reducing the \He4 boiling point and thus the temperature of the bath.
The \He4 is contained withing a sealed reservoir so that the refrigerator acts as a closed system requiring no \He4 replenishment. 
While \He4-sorption fridges are commercially available, our team choose to design and build a custom fridge based on a design that has been proven in astronomical applications\cite{devlin_high_2004}.

\figref{fig:he4sorp} shows a schematic depiction of the \Imager's \He4-sorption refrigerator.
The entire refrigerator is filled with 2.07~moles of \He4 gas, giving a pressure of 900~psi at room temperature.
In normal operation the heat switch between the charcoal pumping chamber (``pump'') and the \He4 condensation plate is closed, keeping the charcoal as cold as possible in order to adsorb as much \He4 as possible, keeping the temperature of the cold plate as low as possible.

\label{fig:he4sorp}
\end{figure*}

Cycling the refrigerator requires four steps.
First the heat switch is opened.
The \He4-sorption refrigerator uses a \He4 gas-gap heat switch manufactured by Chase Cryogenics\footnote{Chase Research Cryogenics, Ltd. Sheffield, UK}, which requires 5 minutes of waiting time in order for the switch to fully open.
Second, the pump is heated by applying \SI{5}{\W} via a \SI{500}{\ohm} power resistor.
This power is applied until the temperature of the pump reaches 40 K, which is high enough to drive nearly all of the adsorbed \He4 off of the charcoal.
Third, the power to the pump is turned off.
Once the temperature of the condensation plate falls below the boiling point of \He4, \He4 will begin to condense on its walls, dripping into the \He4 condensation pot (``pot'').
Fourth, once the temperature of the pot has fallen to 4.0~K, the heat switch is turned back on.
This cools the pump, allowing \He4 to again adsorb onto the charcoal, which has the effect of pumping strongly on the pot, and cooling the \He4 contained there to the base temperature of $\sim$ 970~mK under optical load.
This process is easy to automate, and a LabView program cycles the fridge automatically every night while the system is operating.

Under optical load, a full cycle of the \He4-sorption refrigerator takes approximately 4 hours, reaching a base temperature of $\sim$~970~mK.
When no additional load is applied the hold time is 9 hours.
When the temperature of the stage is held at the typical operating temperature of 1100~mK the hold time is only 3:45 hours.

% xxx - I get 500 uW for the load from the four BOSE wires (300 K -
% 1K). Need to add them to the table. Can this be correct? I'm sure I did this calculation in the past and got a much smaller number. Did I screw up in the past? Is today's calculation in error? Am I intercepting this load at 50~K or 4~K, and I forgot about that? Did I use a much longer wire than 1~m? This could be a big cryogenic problem!

\section{Optical Design}\label{sec:ch4-optical-design}

Because I did not design the optical system, this section merely summarizes information about the optical system required for understanding the remainder of this thesis.

The optical system is a Cassegrain design, chosen for its (relatively) compact size and large field of view (xxx is this right?).
\figref{fig:ch4-xxx} shows a schematic of the optical system including the focal plane.
Light enters the system from the left in this schematic, and bounces off the primary mirror onto the secondary mirror.
From the secondary mirror the light passes through a hole in the center of the primary mirror and through a window into the cryostat.
The cryostat window is a high-density polyethylene (\HDPE) lens that makes the system telecentric; this means that focal surface of the system inside the cryostat is planar, not curved, and simplifies the design of the focal plane.
On the focal plane itself, light is captured by smooth-walled conical feedhorns (see \sectionref{sec:ch4-feedhorn-design}) which funnel the light onto the detectors.

\tableref{tab:ch4-optical-specs} lists imporant properties and parameters for the optical elements of the system.
The most important paramter is the \SI{1.3}{\m} diameter of the primary mirror; this sets the resolution of the overall system.
\figref{sec:ch4-spot-diagrams} shows spot diagrams for the optical system generated by a \ZEMAX\ model. They demonstrate the the system's optical performance is diffraction-limited over the entire focal plane for mirror rotations in both directions of up to \ang{1}, the maximum angle the mirror is ever displaced.
\tableref{tab:ch4-zemax-parms} lists important optical properties of the system obtained from the \ZEMAX\ model.

\section{Feedhorn Design}\label{sec:ch4-feedhorn-design}

% xxx where do I explain the choice of a square grid? Ans: section 6.3
% xxx where do I explain the missing 20 detectors?

Millimeter and submillimeter astronomical instruments using \TES\ detectors use many different strategies for coupling light onto detectors: filled arrays of absorbers\cite{swetz_overview_2011,holland_scuba-2:_2013}, antennas with lenslets\cite{keating_ultra_2011}, phased antenna arrays\cite{obrient_antenna-coupled_2012}, corrugated feedhorns \cite{austermann_sptpol:_2012,niemack_actpol:_2010}, and smooth-walled conical feedhorns \cite{schwan_invited_2011,spt}.
The \Imager\ uses smooth-walled feedhorns because they are easy to design and easy to machine.
Smooth-walled feedhorns do not have the nice polarization properties of corrugated feedhorns \cite{clarricoats_corrugated_1984}, but this is not a concern here because the \Imager\ is polarization-insensitive.

\figref{fig:feedhorn-parms} depicts a smooth-walled conical feedhorn and its interaction with the optical system.
As discussed in section \sectionref{sec:optical-design}, although the optical system has a secondary mirror as well, for many purposes the secondary mirror can be ignored and the system treated as a system of feedhorns illuminating only a primary mirror with a hole in its center.
If a feedhorn is observing a temperature distribution $T_{target}(\theta,\phi)$, and is pointed in a direction $(\theta_0, \phi_0)$, then the temperature observed by the feedhorn will be
\begin{equation}
    T_{eff}(\theta_0,\phi_0) = \int \, d \Omega \, T_{target}(\theta - \theta_0,\phi - \phi_0) P(\theta,\phi).
\end{equation}
The function $P$ is called the ``beam'' or ``beam pattern'' of the feedhorn, and describes the pattern of radiation to which the feedhorn is sensitive.
Although the \Imager\ is always receiving radiation, never transmitting, this thesis often writes about the beam pattern as if it were transmitting radiation, e.g.\ in decribing the portion of the ``beam'' that strikes the primary mirror.
This is acceptable because the transmitting and receiving beam patterns are exactly the same\footnote{This is a consequence of the reciprocity relationships obeyed by the Maxwell equations. See, e.g.\ \cite{balanis_antenna_2005} for a detailed explanation.}.
When using this expression one must keep in mind that the fraction of the beam that spills off the primary mirror (e.g.\ the unshaded region in \figref{fig:feedhorn-parms}) will see not the temperature distribution of the target, but a temperature distribution determined by what is beyond the primary mirror\footnote{Because of the presence of the secondary mirror, some of this temperature distribution will be in front of the system, and some will be behind.}.
The fraction of the beam that strikes the primary mirror and proceeds to the target is called the spillover efficiency $\eta_s$.

\begin{figure*}
\centering
\includegraphics{drawings/ch4-feedhorn-parms.pdf}
\caption{Schematic showing important parameters of a feedhorn and its beam. The beam appears to emerge from the phase center, a distance $l_c$ behind the mouth of the feedhorn in this diagram. The main lobe of the beam is approximated well by a Gaussian, here characterized by a full-width-half-maximum (\FWHM) beam width. The shaded fraction of the Gaussian represents the part of the beam that falls onto the primary mirror and reaches the target.}
\label{fig:feedhorn-parms}
\end{figure*}

The feedhorn opening diameter $D$ is chosen to minimize the total \NETD\ of the system.
The total \NETD\ was given in \sectionref{xxx} as
\begin{equation}
    NETD = \frac{NEP_{tot}}{2 k_B \Delta \nu \eta_{tot} \sqrt{2 \tau}}.
\end{equation}
To make the factors depending on the size of the feedhorns more clear we can break the optical efficiency $\eta_{tot}$ into a product of two factors, $\eta_s$ and $\eta_{other} = \eta_{tot} / \eta_s$.
We then note that the integration time per pixel $\tau$ is inversely proportional to the number of detectors $N$.
This leads to
\begin{equation}
    NETD \propto \frac{NEP_{tot}\sqrt{N}}{\eta_s}.
\end{equation}

The critical relationship is that as a feedhorn's opening diameter increases, the width of the beam becomes smaller.
Small beam angles increase $\eta_s$, which improves \NETD.
However, the diffraction-limited area on the focal plane that can be covered by feedhorns is fixed, so that increases the horn opening diameter reduces the number of detectors $N$, which worsens \NETD.
Choosing an optimal feedhorn size requires trading these two effect off against each other to minimize \NETD.

There are four additional factors to consider.
First, $NEP_{tot}$ is not neccesarily independent of $\eta_s$.
In a detector-noise limited system it will be, but in a system that is photon-noise-limted, $NEP_{tot}$ may worsen, stay the same, or improve, depending on the temperature seen by the spilled over portion of the beam.
Indoors all of the beam will see roughly the same temperature as the target, so that total photon noise will stay the same.
Outdoors the situation is more complicated because the temperature seen by the spilled over beam will depend on the local scenery and weather conditions.
For simplicity, the analysis of optimum feedhorn size in this chaper made the assumption that the noise seen by a detector is independent of the beam size.

Second, for a Cassegrain optical system, $\eta_s$ is not a monotonic function of $D$.
The secondary mirror obstructs the central part of the beam, preventing it from reaching the target.
This means that narrow beams can have poor $\eta_s$ because a large fraction of the main lobe of the beam will be blocked.

Third, the choie of readout system and wiring places a firm upper limit on the number of detectors in the system of 1024.
Fourth, the dependence of the number of detectors $N$ on the feedhorn diameter $D$ is not a smooth function, because it is not possible to have, e.g., 1/3 of a feedhorn.
As explained in \sectionref{xxx6.3}, the \Imager's detectors are laid out on a square grid.
So it is more helpful to think of the feedhorn diameter as a value that can take on a discrete set of values that depends on the number of feedhorns per each side of the grid.

A \MATLAB\ program was used to find the optimum feedhorn size.
The program uses an analytic expression for the beam pattern developed in \cite{green_radiation_2006,narasimhan_modes_1971,}.
The far-field electric field pattern takes the form
\begin{equation}
    \vect{E}(\theta,\phi) = E_{\theta} \sin{\phi} \hat{\theta} + E_{\phi}(\theta) \cos{\phi} \cos{\theta} \hat{\phi}.
\end{equation}
Here $E_{\theta}$ and $E_{\phi}$ are functions depending the horn diameter $D$ and opening half-angle $\alpha$, and involving definite integrals of Bessel functions, not reproduced here.
This expression is for the waveguide mode polarized along the $\pi/2$ direction.
The \Imager's detectors are unpolarized, so detect both waveguide polarizations equally (see \sectionref{xxx} for confirmation of this via simulations).
The total power beam map is thus given by the incoherant sum
\begin{equation}
    P(\theta, \phi) = (|\vect{E}(\theta, \phi)|^2 + |\vect{E}(\theta, \phi+\pi/2)|^2,
\end{equation}
which simplifies to 
\begin{equation}
    P(\theta) = |E_{\theta}(\theta)|^2 + |E_{\phi}(\theta)|^2 \cos{\theta}^2,
\end{equation}
which is independent of $\phi$, as expected for an unpolarized detector.

To calculate the spillover efficiency of an individual feedhorn, the \MATLAB\ program integrates $P$ over the angles $\theta$ that illuminate the primary mirror and reach the target: \SIrange{5.3}{13.6}{\degree}\footnote{see \sectionref{sec:optical-design}}.
\figref{fig:spill-vs-alpha-diam} shows a contour plot of spillover efficiency as a function of $D$ and $\alpha$.
The blue asterisk matches the parameters for the feedhorns chosen for the \Imager.
This plot makes it clear that $\eta_s$ depends much more strongly on $D$ than on $\alpha$.
$\alpha = \SI{9.4}{\degree}$ was chosen as a value that is easy to machine, keeps the thermal mass of the feedhorn array relatively low (small values of $\alpha$ lead to long feedhorns and higher thermal mass), and it not too far from the maximum achievable $\eta_s$ for any fixed feedhorn diameter $D$.

\label{fig:spill-vs-alpha-diam}
\end{figure*}

The feedhorn diameter chosen does not maximize $\eta_s$, because it turned out that a smaller \NETD\ could be achieved by using a larger number of smaller feedhorns.
In fact, as \figref{fig:netd-num-feeds} shows, an even larger number of even smaller feedhorns is predicted to reduce \NETD\ by xxx \%.
However, as mentiond above, the maximum number of detectors that can be readout by our system is 1024, so $D = xxx$ was chosen as the optimal feedhorn diameter.

\caption{Plot showing how total number of detectors and system \NETD\ depend on diameter chosen for feedhorns. The number of detectors is a discrete function of the feedhorn diameter because it is not possible to have a fractional part of a feedhorn. \NETD\ is maximized with xxx feedhorns of diameter xxx, but the \Imager\ uses 1004 feedhorns of diameter xxx because of readout limitations. xxx Is this plot right? I chose 2.68 mm (cold), which leads to ~800 detectors, not 1024.}
