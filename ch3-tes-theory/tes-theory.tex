\chapter{TES Bolometer Theory}\label{c:tes}

This chapter summarizes the \TES\ theory used in this thesis.
I start by describing the \TES electrical and thermal circuits, defining relevant parameters, and stating the linearized \TES\ equations.
For reference I then summarize the import consequences of these equations, including expressions for detector responsivity, detector response to step functions in applied power and bias current, and detector noise.
I do not derive most of these results, because excellent references for these results are available\cite{irwin2005transition}.

I discuss the derivation of two results in detail.
First, I describe a new approach for measuring the natural detector time constant $\tau$ by extrapolating several measurements of the effective detector time constant $\tau_{eff}$ high in the transition. 
Second, I give an expression for the time-domain response to a step function in applied detector bias current.

\section{\TES\ Electrical And Thermal Circuits}

\figref{fig:elec-thermal-circuit} shows the electrical and thermal circuits for a \TES\ bolometer.
The bolometer is voltage-biased by passing a bias current $I_{bias}$ through a shunt resistor \Rsh\ which has a much lower resistance than the normal-state resistance $R_n$ of the \TES.
The current through the \TES\ is inductively coupled into a \SQUID\ for readout.
The inductance $L$ in the diagram represents the sum of the input inductance of the \SQUID, a Nyquist Inductor, and any parasitic inductance present in the circuit.

The \TES\ itself is represented by a variable resistance $R$, which depends on both the current through the \TES\ and the temperature of the \TES.
The \TES\ is thermally connected heat capacity $C$ which is weakly linked to a temperature bath $T_b$ through a thermal conductance $G$.
Optical power falls onto the heat capacity, causing the temperature $T$ of the heat capacity and the \TES\ to rise above $T_b$.
Joule power dissipated in the \TES\ also contributes to this temperature rise, as does power dissipated in any heater resistor present on the \TES\footnote{As described in \sectionref{xxx}, 31~detectors have heater resistors.}.

Because the resistance of the \TES\ depends on the temperature of the \TES, and the temperature of the \TES depends on the resistance of the \TES through Joule heating, the electrical and thermal behavior of the \TES are coupled.
This coupling acts as feedback, termed ``negative electrothermal feedback'', first described in the context of \TES\ detectors by Irwin\cite{irwin1995application}.
That this coupling acts as negative feedback can be seen as follows.
As the optical power falling on the \TES\ increases, the temperature of the \TES\ increases, which causes the resistance of the \TES\ to increase as well.
Because the \TES\ is voltage-biased, the Joule heating is inversely proportional to the resistance, so the Joule heating decreases, which causes the temperature of the \TES\ to decrease, opposing the effect of the increased optical power.

\section{Linearized Electrical and Thermal Circuits}

In the limit of small changes in \TES\ current and temperature, the resistance of te \TES\ can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
R(T_0+\delta T,I_0+\delta I) = R_0 + \alpha \frac{R_0}{T_0} \delta T + %
									 \beta_I \frac{R_0}{I_0} \delta I.
\end{equation}
The power flowing through the thermal link $G$ is assumed to follow a power law of the form
\begin{eqnarray}
P_{bath} = K(T^n - T^n_{bath}),
\end{eqnarray}
which can also be written in the form
\begin{eqnarray}
P_{bath} = \frac{GT}{n}\left(1 - \left(\frac{T_{bath}}{T}\right)^2\right),
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{equation}
G \equiv \frac{d P_{bath}}{dT} = K n T^{n-1}.
\end{equation}

With these definitions it can be shown\cite{irwin2005transition} that the behavior of the \TES\ is described by a pair of coupled first-order differential equations:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d}{\mathop{dt}} \begin{pmatrix} \delta I \\ \delta T \end{pmatrix}
	= - \mathcal{M} \begin{pmatrix}	\delta I \\	\delta T \end{pmatrix}
      + \begin{pmatrix} \delta V / L \\ \delta P /C \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
where the matrix $\mathcal{M}$ is
\begin{equation}
% For spacing see http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/14071/how-can-i-increase-the-line-spacing-in-a-matrix
\mathcal{M} = \begin{pmatrix}
		\frac{1}{\tau_{el}} & \frac{\Loop G}{I_0 L} \\[0.75em] 
		-\frac{I_0 R_0(2 + \beta_I)}{C} & \frac{1}{\tau_I}
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
\tableref{tab:tes-theory-summary} describes all symbols use in these equations and the rest of the chapter.

These coupled equations can be solved under different initial conditions and applied forces $\delta V$ and $\delta P$.
Discussion of several cases follows.

\textbf{\TES\ Power-to-Current Responsivity}
Driving the \TES\ with a sinusoidal $\delta P$ term, holding detector bias constant, leads to the following expression for the detector power-to-current responsivity:
\begin{equation}
s_I(\omega) = 
- \frac{ \frac{1}{V0} \frac{1}{\gamma} \frac{\Loop}{\Loop + 1} }
       { 1 + j \omega \left( \tau_{eff} - \frac{1}{\gamma}\frac{\Loop}{\Loop + 1} \frac{L}{R_0}\right) - \omega^2 \frac{L}{R_0}\frac{\tau_{eff}}{1 + \beta_I + R_L / R_0}},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\gamma \equiv 1 + \frac{\beta_I}{1+\Loop} - \frac{\Loop - 1}{\Loop + 1}\frac{R_L}{R_0}.
\end{equation}
While imposing, these expressions are much simpler in the limit which generally hold for operating \TES\ detectors: strong voltage bias ($R_L \ll R_0$), and $\tau \ll L/R$. 
In this limit the power-to-current responsivity becomes
\begin{equation}
s_I(\omega) = -\frac{1}{V_0} \frac{\Loop}{1+\beta_I + \Loop} \frac{1}{1 + j \omega \frac{\tau}{1 +\Loop/(1+\beta_I)}}
\end{equation}
The detector response time is given by the natural detector time constant $\tau$, sped up by a factor of $1 + \Loop(1+\beta_I)$; for $\beta_I \ll 1$, this factor is typical of negative feedback, and justifies calling \Loop the ``loop gain'' of the detector.
In the further limit of strong electrothermal feedback ($\Loop \gg 1, \gg \beta_I$), the \DC responsivity is simply the inverse of the voltage bias.
This represents that fact that under strong strong electrothermal an increase in applied optical power is exactly canceled by a decrease in detector Joule heating, so that the \TES\ temperature remains unchanged.

\textbf{\TES\ Response to Step Function in Power}
Heater resistors can be used to apply step function in power to the detectors.
Solving the equations under the conditions
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} \delta I(0) \\ \delta T(0) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
with constant driving force starting at time zero of
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \delta P_{htr} / C \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
leads to the following expression for the \TES\ current as a function of time:
\begin{equation}
xxx
\end{equation}

\textbf{\TES\ Response to Step Function in Bias Current}
To derive the behavior of the \TES\ after a step function in applied bias, we solve the equations under the conditions
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} \delta I(0) \\ \delta T(0) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
with constant driving force starting at time zero of
\begin{equation}
\begin{pmatrix} \delta I_{bias} R_{sh} / L \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
Solving this system leads to the following expression for the \TES\ current as a function of time:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:bias-step-resp}
\delta I (t)
   = - \frac{\delta I_{bias} R_{sh}}{R_0} 
       \frac{\Loop - 1}{1 + \beta_I + R_L/R_0 + \Loop(1 - R_L/R_0)}
       \left(1 - \frac{\tau_{eff} - \tau_I}{\tau_{eff} - \tau_{el}} e^{-t/\tau_{eff}}
    	       + \frac{\tau_{el} - \tau_I}{\tau_{eff} - \tau_{el}} e^{-t/\tau_{el}} \right).
\end{equation}
This expression is complicated, but the behavior can be understood as follows.
Immediately after an increase in bias current the current flowing through the \TES\ begins to increase, with a time constant of $\tau_{el}$.
As the current through the \TES increases, the Joule power in the \TES\ will also begin to increase, which warms the \TES.
This warming increases the resistance of the \TES.
Because the \TES is voltage-biased, this reduces Joule power in the \TES, which tends to cool the detector as well as reduce current through the detector.
This negative electrothermal feedback effect occurs with a time constant of $\tau_{eff}$.
Whether the final current through the \TES\ is higher or lower than the original currents depends on the loop gain.
For $\Loop < 1$ the current increases, for $\Loop > 1$ it decreases and for $\Loop = 0$ the current through the \TES\ remains unchanged.

\eqnref{eqn:bias-step-resp} depends on \Loop and $\beta_I$ in a complicated way through $\tau_{eff}$, $\tau_I$, $\tau_{el}$, and the prefactor.
Nevertheless, if the response of a \TES\ to a bias step can be measured with sufficient bandwidth to track the initial fast electrical response, bias steps can be used to measure \Loop and $\beta_I$ by performing non-linear parameter fitting to \eqnref{eqn:bias-step-resp}.
Measurements \Loop and $\beta_I$ using this technique are described in \sectionref{xxx}.

When the \TES\ is superconducting, \eqnref{eqn:bias-step-resp} takes on a much simpler form.
Setting $R_0 = \Loop = \beta_I = 0$, the result is
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:bias-step-resp-sc}
\delta I(t)
   = - \frac{\delta I_{bias} R_{sh}}{R_{L}} 
       \left(1 - e^{-t/(L/R_L)} \right).
\end{equation}
Similarly, when the detector is fully normal, so that $\Loop = \beta_I = $, \eqnref{eqn:bias-step-resp} becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:bias-step-resp-normal}
\delta I(t)
   = - \frac{\delta I_{bias} R_{sh}}{R_n + R_{L}} 
       \left(1 - e^{-t/(L/(R_n+R_L))} \right).
\end{equation}
The \TES\ response to bias steps in the superconducting and normal states can thus be used as measurements of $L$ and $R_n$.
