\title{A 350 GHz Video Imaging System}

\begin{abstract}
Passive millimeter-wavelength video imaging systems hold promise for detection of security threats at a distance, such as suicide bomb belts and maritime threats in fog.
Achieving optimal noise and optical performance for these system requires large numbers of cryogenic millimeter-wavelength radiation detectors. Large-format arrays of superconducting Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers have been proven to meet requirement for both noise and number of detectors. xxx get rid of passive here.
We are developing a video- rate millimeter-wavelength imaging system using 1004 TES bolometers as detectors.
This demonstration system is intended to have photon-noise-limited performance, and will be used to investigate phenomenology of passive millimeter-wavelength video images, with the goal of identifying what performance tradeoffs can be made when building a deployable system.
It observes light in a 10\% band centered at 350 GHz, and is designed to take video images at distances ranging from 16 m to 28 m.
When operating at 16 m, the resolution is 1 cm over a 1 m by 1 m field of view.
The system is predicted to take video images with a noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) of 100 mK at 20 frames per second.
This thesis describes the design and implementation of this system, as well as imaging results from the first 251-detector subarray to be installed.

% Instead, the image is dominated by speckle that is characteristic for coherent imaging. Speckle comes from the large variations in the intensity of backscattered radiation coming from the diversity in angles of the beam-target incidence, and it dominates any difference in the intrinsic reï¬‚ectivity of, say, PVC pipe material, clothing, and skin.
