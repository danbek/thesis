\begin{abstract}
Passive millimeter-wavelength video imaging systems hold promise for detection of security threats at a distance, such as suicide bomb belts and maritime threats in fog.
Achieving optimal noise and optical performance for these system requires large numbers of cryogenic millimeter-wavelength radiation detectors. Large-format arrays of superconducting Transition Edge Sensor (TES) bolometers meet these requirement for both noise and number of detectors.
We are developing a video- rate millimeter-wavelength imaging system using 1004 TES bolometers as detectors.
This demonstration system aims to achieve photon-noise-limited performance, and will be used to investigate phenomenology of passive millimeter-wavelength video images, with the goal of identifying what performance tradeoffs can be made when building a deployable system.
It observes light in a 10\% band centered at 350 GHz, and is designed to take video images at distances ranging from 16 m to 28 m.
When operating at 16 m, the resolution is 1 cm over a 1 m by 1 m field of view.
The system is predicted to take video images with a noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) of 100 mK at 20 frames per second.
This thesis describes the design and implementation of this system, as well as imaging results from the first 251-detector subarray to be installed.
