\chapter{Subarray Characterization}\label{c:det-array}

The first 251-detector subarray has not yet been characterized as thoroughly as the prototype detectors.
In particular, only seven good have been characterized.
The reason for this is that the saturation power of the detectors is xxx time higher than expected, which means that only some detectors be driven normal, and only at bath temperatures very close to $T_c$.
In particular, none of the detector can be driven normal at the operating bath temperature for the array of 1100~mK.
This means that we do not have \IV\ curves for any detectors at operating conditions, which limits the characterization than can be performed.

Seven detectors used in taking images have working heaters and no other problems.
These heaters allow us to take full \IV\ curves at all bath temperatures, allowing estimate of the detector thermal conductance $G$.
The heaters also allow a direct measurement of detector responsivity and time constants, and thus allow a measurement of detector noise referred to optical power incident on the detector.
This chapter describes these measurements on these seven detectors, as well as measurements of shunt resistor an inductances for all detectors.

Note that this lack of detector characterization does not prevent the array from working.
It merely limits our understanding of the behavior of the detectors.
A more detailed characterization of more detectors will be carried out prior to fabrication of any additional arrays.

\section{Choice of \MCE\ Servo Gain Parameters}

As described in \sectionref{xxx}, the \MCE\ operates the \SQUID\ multiplexing system.
It supports extensive configuration options ranging from \SQUID\ bias current values to mulitplexing speed, to the order in which rows should be reported to client software. xx need reference to MCE stuff
This thesis does not describe the process of chosing most of these parameters.
The one exception is the choice of \PID\ parameters for the flux-locked-loop servo that linearizes the output of the \SQUID\ amplifier chain.
This section describes the choice of these parameters for different readout situations.

The feedback applied to an \SQ1 during frame $n+1$ is defined as \cite{mce_team_data_2013}
\begin{equation}
  FB_{n+1} = \frac{1}{2^{12}} \left[P q_n + I \sum_{i=1}^n e_i + D (e_n - e_{n-1}) \right].
\end{equation}
Here $e_n$ is the error observed during frame $n$, $q_n \equiv e_n + b q_n$ (where $b$ is some number small than 1), and $P$, $I$, and $D$ are the proportional, integral, and derivatve terms of the PID loop, respectively.
The $FB$ values are expressed in terms of \DAC\ counter units applied to the \SQ1 feedback, and the errors $e$ are in terms of \ADC\ values for the output of the readout chain.
The \Imager is operated with $P = D = 0$, so that the feedback simplifies to
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:mce-pid-i-only}
  FB_{n+1} = \frac{I}{2^{12}} \sum_{i=1}^n e_i.
\end{equation}

Using only $I$, the \MCE\ servo loop acts like a 1-pole filter.
Higher values of $I$ increase the bandwidth of this filter until a ``critical gain'' is reached, as which point the feedback loop becomes unstable and begins to oscillate.
$I$ should be chosen so that the the bandwidth of this filter is greater than that of the detectors themselves, but $I$ should not approach the critical gain too closely.

The servo $I$ parameter was chosen to minimize \SQUID\ noise and allow sufficient bandwidth to readout the full bandwidth of the detectors.
The target servo bandwidth depends on the measurement being made.
When operating the array in normal conditions, the data readout rate is either \SI{3125}{Hz} or \SI{3030.3}{Hz}, depending on whether the dark \SQUID\ is read out.
The time constant for the associated Nyquist frequencies are \abt~\SI{0.1}{ms}, so there is no need to use $I$ values with more bandwidth than this\footnote{In fact doing so is counter-productive, because it will alias \SQUID\ noise into the detector band}.
Electrical detector time constants are \abt~\SI{4}{ms} in the superconducting state, and \abt~\SI{0.14}{ms} in the normal state.
While biased into the transition, $\tau_{eff}$ is in the range \SIrange{1}{4}{ms}.
\figref{fig:ch8-servo-tau-est} shows the impact of the servo rolloff on estimation of time constants from single-pole response functions.
To reduce the error in the estimated time constant below \SI{2}{\percent}, the servo time constant should be below \SI{5}{\percent} of the time constant to be measured.
This criteria corresponds to \SI{2e-4}{s} for the superconducting state and as fast as \SI{5e-5}{s} for detectors operating in the transition.

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics{drawings/ch8-servo-tau-est.pdf}
\caption{Plots summarizing requirements on $\tau_{servo}$ for accurate measurements of detector time constants.
\textbf{Left} Plot showing exact response to step function of a detector with $\tau = \SI{4}{ms}$, the response as filtered by a servo with $\tau_{servo} = \SI{1}{ms}$, and the best fit to the filtered response. The estimated $\tau$ is \SI{23}{\percent} too high.
\textbf{Right} Plot showing fraction overestimate of $\tau$ vs. relative size of $\tau_{servo}$.
For less than \SI{2}{\percent} error, $\tau_{servo}/\tau < \num{0.05}$ is required.
}
\label{fig:ch8-servo-tau-est}
\end{figure*}

Measuring the bandwidth of the servo loop is challenging because when the detectors are in the superconducting state the Johnson noise of the shunt resistor is higher than the \SQUID\ noise and the Johnson noise rolloff is \abt \SI{4}{\ms}, both factors which make it difficult to identify the servo rolloff from power spectra.
However, if the bath temperature is raised above $T_c$ for the Al wirebonds connecting the \TES\ circuit to the input coils of the 1st stage \SQUIDs, the total resistance of the \TES\ circuit is raised from \SI{150}{\uohm} to \SIrange{20}{50}{\mohm}.
This high resistance drives the Johnson noise of the load resistor below the \SQUID\ noise, and pushes the $L/R$ rolloff of the Johnson noise to \SI{3e-5}{s} or faster (\SI{3}{\dB} frequency of \SI{5}{\kilo\Hz} or higher), making a measurement of the servo bandwidth much easier.

To choose $I$ values, I acquired data at the fastest multiplexing rate possible for 33 rows\footnote{This rate is achieved by only reporting one of the eight columns to the readout computer. The limiting factor in how fast the entire array can be multiplexed is packaging and sending the data to the readout computer.}, \SI{15151.5}{Hz} while the system was at a temperature of \SI{1.3}{\K}.
For evern row and column that has a detector that responds in the superconducting step, I fit the resulting noise power spectrum to an equation of the form
\begin{equation}
  \frac{N_{SQ}}{1 + (2 \pi \tau_{servo})^2},
\end{equation}
Where $N_{SQ}$ is the white noise level and $\tau_{servo}$ gives the bandwidth of the servo loop.

\figref{fig:ch8-servo} shows the resulting white noise levels and $\tau_{servo}$ values for a range of servo gain values $I$.
The \SQUID\ white noise level is higher when operating with negative $I$ values, so we have chosen to use positive $I$ values.

\section{Shunt Resistance Measurements}

Our shunt resistors are located on interface chips that contain both shunt resistors and Nyquist inductors.
The specific chips used were extra chips leftover from the ABS\cite{kusaka_modulation_2013} project.
The design resistance of the shunts was \SI{180}{\uohm}, and the design inductance was 609~nH\footnote{John Appel, personal communication}.
Each chips contains 32 shunt resistors and 32 inductors.

To measure $R_{sh}$ and $L$ for these chips I took noise measurements using zero detector bias current at two different bath temperature: 980~mK and 1160~mK.
At these bath temperatures and at zero detector bias the detectors are superconducting, so that measured noise is due to the shunt resistor, and parasitic resistance, and SQUID noise in the multiplexed readout system itself.
Data was collected at 3030.3~Hz, and 20 data acquisitions lasting 33 seconds were taken at each bath temperature.

A power spectrum was estimated for each detector for each data acquisition using \MATLAB's \texttt{pwelch} function, using a \FFT\ size of $2^{12}$.
Each resulting power spectrum was fit to a function of the form
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqn:scnoise-fit}
	\frac{4 k_B T_b}{R_{sh}} \frac{1}{1 + (2 \pi f (L/R_{sh}))^2} + SQ,
\end{eqnarray}
where $k_B$ is Boltzmann's constant, $T_b$ is the bath temperature for the measurement, and $f$ is the frequency.
The shunt resistance $R_{sh}$, inductance $L$, and readout chain white noise level $SQ$ are the values extracted from the fit.

\figref{fig:rsh-l-plots} shows histogram plots of the resulting \Rsh\ and $L$ values.
\Rsh\ has a mean of \SI{149}{\uohm} with standard deviation \SI{6}{\uohm}.
The meassured value for \Rsh\ also includes any parasitic resistance in the circuit, but no evidence for significant parasitic resistance has ever been seen, so this parasitic resistance is assumed to be zero.

The measured value for $L$ includes the Nyquist inductance on the interface chip, the input inductance of the first-stage \SQUID\ of the multiplexed readout system, as well as any parasitic inductance in the circuit.
Using this measurement it is not possible to extract the inductance of the Nyqust inductor itself, but this is not a problem because the total inductance is the relevant  quantity for understanding the behavior of the detector and it's circuit.

$L$ has a mean of 574~nH with a standard deviation of 87~nH.
However, this mean includes two sets of clear outliers: all values for multiplexing row 4 are clustered around 200~nH, and all values for multiplexing row 25 are clustered around 440~nH.
The reason for these low inductances is not understood.
Excluding rows 4 and 25,  $L$ has a mean of 593~nH with a standard deviation of 44~nH.

The outlier $L$ values are more clearly visible in the lower left plot in \figref{fig:rsh-l-plots}, which also shows a small correlation between \Rsh\ and $L$.
It is not known whether this correlation is a real physical effect or an artifact of the measurement process.

\section{Measurement of Heater Resistors}

Only 23 of the 251 detectors have heaters wired up.
Of these 23, there are nine detectors which show no response to applied heater power.
Five of these nine are on the cut list (xxx see ch xxx), so this is not surprising.
But four detectors can be biased into the transition and work well, but show no response to applied heater power (\RC{4}{7}, \RC{5}{7}, \RC{6}{6}, \RC{7}{6}).
The reasons for these detectors not showing a response to heater power are not fully understood.
This leaves 14 working detectors that also show a response to applied heater power.
However, a short between one of the \TES\ bias lines and the heater bias line means that ramping the current bias for some of the \TES\ detectors also ramps the heater bias.
This means that for seven of the 14 working detectors that show a response to applied heate power, interpreting \IV\ curves is difficult because a different amount of heater power is applied at each detector bias value.
This means that for these seven detectors it is not possible to measure $G$ or to calibrate the power being applied by the resistors.

This leaves seven detectors with heaters for which \IV\ curves can be taken, and $G$ measured.
The heaters on these seven detectors can be used to directly measure the detector responsivity, noise referred to input optical power, time constants and thermal conductance $G$.
But all of these measurements require knowing the resistance of the heaters.
This section describes my measurement of the heater resistances.

To measure the heater resistances, I took a set of \IV\ curves at constant bath temperature.
For each \IV\ curve I applied a different heater current, so that a different amount of heater power was applied to the \TES\ for each curve.
The total amount of power flowing through the \TES\ thermal conductance $G$ is then given by
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:tes-ptot}
P_{tot} = K(T^n - T_b^n) = P_{opt} + P_{htr} + I^2 R(T,I),
\end{equation}
where $T$ is the temperature of the \TES, $R$ is the resistance of the \TES, and $I$ is the current flowing through the \TES.
I make the assumption that at the start of the superconducting transition $\beta_I = 0$, i.e.\ the resistance of the \TES\ depends only on the \TES\ temperature, and not on the current through the \TES.
This implies that each time the \TES\ reaches, e.g.\ $0.99R_n$, the temperature of the \TES\ is the same, and therefore $P_{tot}$ will be the same.
A relationship of the following form must therefore hold:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:rhtr-fit}
P_{J} = (P_{tot} - P_{opt}) - I_{htr}^2 R_{htr}.
\end{equation}
A fit can be made to this function, with the quantities $R_{htr}$ and $P_{x} \equiv P_{tot} - P_{opt}$ to be solved for.

\figref{fig:heater-r-plots} explains this idea further by a series of plots.
The upper left plot shows the \TES\ \IV\ curves.
The upper right plot shows the same data, but transformed into \TES\ Joule power and \TES\ resistance.
As applied heater current decreases, the Joule power at the start of the transition decreases.
In the lower left, the Joule power at $0.99R_{n}$ is plotted vs applied heater current.
A fit to \eqnref{eqn:rhtr-fit} is also plotted.
Finally, the lower right plot show the $R$ vs $P_J$ plots after the heater power has been added to each curve.
This plots shows that the powers are equalized very high in the transition, where the assumption of Joule power dependent only on \TES\ resistance holds.
It also shows that this assumption breaks down deeper in the transition.

\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics{drawings/ch8-heater-r-plots.pdf}
\caption{Plots heater measurements, for the case of \RCm{29}{1}.
\textbf{Upper Left} \IV\ curves. The \IV\ curves should turn completely vertial when the detector becomes fully superconducting at zero voltage, but these curves shown a non-infinite slope. The reason for this is that the readout system as configured for these \IV\ curves was unable keep up with the rapid change of current in the superconducting branch.
\textbf{Upper Right} Same data as in upper left plot, but represented in terms of \TES\ Joule power and resistance. As the bias current for the heaters is increased, the curves shift to the left.

\textbf{Lower Right} Same plot as upper right, but the heater power based on $R_{htr} = \SI{23.6}{\ohm}$ has been added to each curve.}
\label{fig:heater-r-plots}
\end{figure*}

\tableref{tab:all-det-props} lists all measured heater resistors.
The seven heaters for columns 0 and 1 have a mean of \SI{23.8}{\ohm} with a standard deviation of \SI{0.26}{\ohm}.

It is worth noting that determining the values of $R_{htr}$ requires knowing the current through the heaters.
But because $R_{htr}$ is determined through the power disspiated in the resistor, an incorrect assumption about will lead to a an incorrect value of $R_{htr}$ which leaves $I_{htr}^2 R_{htr}$ unchanged.
So whenever the value $R_{htr}$ is used to calculated a power, the power value will be correct even in the face of an incorrect assumption about the current through the heater.

\section{Measurement of \TES\ $G$}

With knowledge of the heater resistances, \IV\ curves can be taken over a wide range of bath temperatures, which enables a measurement of the \TES\ thermal conductance $G$.
Similarly to \sectionref{xxx}, I took \IV\ curves at bath temperatures ranging from 995~mK -- 1160~mK, while adjusting the applied heater power so that each \IV\ curve had a clear normal branch.
I again used the assumption that high in the transition the \TES\ resistance depends on only the \TES\ temperature, so that the Joule power $P_J$ dissipated in the \TES\ at $0.99R_n$ depends only on the bath temperature $T_b$ and the applied heater power $P_{htr} = I_{htr}^2 R_{htr}$. A fit can then be made to \eqnref{eqn:tes-ptot} in the form
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:g-fit}
P_{htr} + P_J + P_{opt}= \frac{G T_c}{n}\left(1 - \left(\frac{T_b}{T_c}\right)^n\right).
\end{equation}
The parameters to be fit to are $G$, $T_c$, and $n$.

A problem arises because the data described in this section were taken when the cryostat was open, so that $P_{opt}$ was non-zero, with an unknown value.
Because $P_{opt}$ is a simple additive constant, it is not possible to fit for this value unless another constraint (such as the value of $T_c$) is known.
However, the value of $P_{opt}$ can be estimated in two different ways. 
First, the predicted optical load of 165~pW from \sectionref{xxx} can be used.
Second, optical load on the prototype detectors was estimated to be in the range 135~pW--165~pW (xxx ref some section).
In this analysis I assume $P_{opt} = 150$~pW, while also showing how different assumptions change the values of  $G$, $T_c$, and $n$.

\tableref{tab:all-det-props} lists the resulting values for $G$, $T_c$ and $n$.
\figref{fig:heater-g-plots} contains plots summarizing and explaining this data.
The uncertainties in $G$, $T_c$ and $n$ introduced by the unknown value of $P_{opt}$ are different.
$G$'s uncertainty from $P_{opt}$ is about the same size as the statistical uncertainty due to the fit, while $T_c$'s uncertainity from $P_{opt}$ is much larger than the statistical uncertainty.
Both of these uncertainties should be taken into account when predicting measurement of detector noise.
$n$ shows no apparent trend with $P_{opt}$.

\begin{figure*}

As discussed in \sectionref{xxx}, the target $G$ value for these detectors was 3.7~nW/K.

The reason for this discrepancy is not known.

Prediction of detector G noise

xxx - need to account for correlation between G, n, Tc that arrises from the fit.
Answer: there is a strong correlationbetween G and n, should plot these ellipses on G vs n plot. ALso covariance with Tc, which you can account for in noise predcitions, but makes little difference.

should at least look at all psat vs temp plots.

should work out $P_{sat}$ vs $T_b$ expansion to order $(\Delta T)^2$ - might help with above.

\section{Direct Measurement of Detector Responsivity and $\tau_{eff}$}

Knowledge of $R_{htr}$ allows a direct measurement of the DC responsivity of $\tau_{eff}$ for the seven detectors with heaters.
Steps is heater bias current were applied to these detectors while bias at typically operating conditions ($T_b = 1100$~mK, DAC$_{bias}$ = 27000).
The step size was made small so as the keep the detector response linear, and the response to many steps was averaged together to reduce noise.
The result was fit to an equation of the form
\begin{equation} \label{eqn:ch8-heater-step-trans}
  \delta I(t) = - \delta P_{htr} s_I(0) (1 - e^{-t/\tau_{eff}}),
\end{equation}
which is just \eqnref{eqn:htr-step-resp-high-time} with the the \DC\ responsivity explicitly inserted.

\figref{fig:ch8-heater-step-trans} shows a sample fit to \eqnref{eqn:ch8-heater-step-trans}.
\tableref{tab:all-det-props} lists the best-fit values of $s_I(0)$ and $\tau_{eff}$.
