In this sensor, the temperature of a superconducting film is held constant by feeding back to its position on the resistive transition edge. Energy deposited in the film is measured by a reduction in the feedback Joule heating. This mode of operation should lead to substantial improvements in resolution, linearity, dynamic range, and count rate. Fundamental resolution limits are below {ΔE=√kT} 2 C, which is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the thermodynamic limit. This performance is better than any existing technology operating at the same temperature, count rate, and absorber heat capacity. Applications include high resolution x‐ray spectrometry, dark matter searches, and neutrino detection.},

	abstract = {In recent years, superconducting transition-edge sensors ({TES)} have emerged as powerful, energyresolving detectors of single photons from the near infrared through gamma rays and sensitive detectors of photon fluxes out to millimeter wavelengths. The {TES} is a thermal sensor that measures an energy deposition by the increase of resistance of a superconducting film biased within the superconducting-to-normal transition. Small arrays of {TES} sensors have been demonstrated, and kilopixel arrays are under development. In this chapter, we describe the theory of the superconducting phase transition, derive the {TES} calorimeter response and noise theory, discuss the state of understanding of excess noise, and describe practical implementation issues including materials choice, pixel design, array fabrication, and cryogenic {SQUID} multiplexing.},

The demodulated {TOD} is stable on time scales of 500-1000 seconds, corresponding to frequencies of 1-2 {mHz.} This facilitates recovery of cosmological information at large angular scales, which are typically available only from balloon-borne or satellite experiments. This technique also achieves a sensitive measurement of celestial polarization without differencing the {TOD} of paired detectors sensitive to two orthogonal linear polarizations. This is the first demonstration of the ability to remove atmospheric contamination at these levels from a ground-based platform using a rapidly-rotating {HWP.}},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2101},
	abstract = {Observations of the temperature anisotropy of the Cosmic Microwave Background ({CMB)} lend support to an inflationary origin of the universe, yet no direct evidence verifying inflation exists. Many current experiments are focussing on the {CMB's} polarization anisotropy, specifically its curl component (called {"B-mode"} polarization), which remains undetected. The inflationary paradigm predicts the existence of a primordial gravitational wave background that imprints a unique B-mode signature on the {CMB's} polarization at large angular scales. The {CMB} B-mode signal also encodes gravitational lensing information at smaller angular scales, bearing the imprint of cosmological large scale structures ({LSS)} which in turn may elucidate the properties of cosmological neutrinos. The quest for detection of these signals; each of which is orders of magnitude smaller than the {CMB} temperature anisotropy signal, has motivated the development of background-limited detectors with precise control of systematic effects. The {POLARBEAR} experiment is designed to perform a deep search for the signature of gravitational waves from inflation and to characterize lensing of the {CMB} by {LSS.} {POLARBEAR} is a 3.5 meter ground-based telescope with 3.8 arcminute angular resolution at 150 {GHz.} At the heart of the {POLARBEAR} receiver is an array featuring 1274 antenna-coupled superconducting transition edge sensor ({TES)} bolometers cooled to 0.25 Kelvin. {POLARBEAR} is designed to reach a tensor-to-scalar ratio of 0.025 after two years of observation -- more than an order of magnitude improvement over the current best results, which would test physics at energies near the {GUT} scale. {POLARBEAR} had an engineering run in the Inyo Mountains of Eastern California in 2010 and will begin observations in the Atacama Desert in Chile in 2011.},

The receiver contains a focal plane of 280 superconducting transition-edge sensor ({TES)} bolometers instrumented with a frequency-domain multiplexed readout system. The bolometers are cooled to 280 {mK} via a three-stage helium sorption refrigerator and a mechanical pulse-tube cooler. Three warm mirrors, two 4 K lenses, and a horn array couple the {TES} bolometers to the telescope. {APEX-SZ} observes in a single frequency band at 150 {GHz} with 1′ angular resolution and a 22′ field-of-view, all well suited for cluster mapping. The {APEX-SZ} receiver has played a key role in the introduction of several new technologies including {TES} bolometers, the frequency-domain multiplexed readout, and the use of a pulse-tube cooler with bolometers. As a result of these new technologies, the instrument has a higher instantaneous sensitivity and covers a larger field-of-view than earlier generations of Sunyaev-Zel\&apos;dovich instruments. The {TES} bolometers have a median sensitivity of 890 μ K {CMB} s ({NEy} of 3.5 × 10−4 s ). We have also demonstrated upgraded detectors with improved sensitivity of 530 μ K {CMB} s ({NEy} of 2.2 × 10−4 s ). Since its commissioning in April 2007, {APEX-SZ} has been used to map 48 clusters. We describe the design of the receiver and its performance when installed on the {APEX} telescope.},

With two imaging arrays working simultaneously in the atmospheric windows at 450 and 850 μm, the vast increase in pixel count means that {SCUBA-2} maps the sky 100–150 times faster than the previous {SCUBA} instrument. In this paper, we present an overview of the instrument, discuss the physical characteristics of the superconducting detector arrays, outline the observing modes and data acquisition, and present the early performance figures on the telescope. We also showcase the capabilities of the instrument via some early examples of the science {SCUBA-2} that have already been undertaken. In 2012 February, {SCUBA-2} began a series of unique legacy surveys for the {JCMT} community. These surveys will take 2.5 yr and the results are already providing complementary data to the shorter wavelength, shallower, larger area surveys from Herschel. The {SCUBA-2} surveys will also provide a wealth of information for further study with new facilities such as {ALMA}, and future telescopes such as {CCAT} and {SPICA.}},

	abstract = {{SPTpol} is a dual-frequency polarization-sensitive camera that was deployed on the 10-meter South Pole Telescope in January 2012. {SPTpol} will measure the polarization anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ({CMB)} on angular scales spanning an arcminute to several degrees. The polarization sensitivity of {SPTpol} will enable a detection of the {CMB} {“B-mode”} polarization from the detection of the gravitational lensing of the {CMB} by large scale structure, and a detection or improved upper limit on a primordial signal due to inationary gravity waves. The two measurements can be used to constrain the sum of the neutrino masses and the energy scale of ination. These science goals can be achieved through the polarization sensitivity of the {SPTpol} camera and careful control of systematics. The {SPTpol} camera consists of 768 pixels, each containing two transition-edge sensor ({TES)} bolometers coupled to orthogonal polarizations, and a total of 1536 bolometers. The pixels are sensitive to light in one of two frequency bands centered at 90 and 150 {GHz}, with 180 pixels at 90 {GHz} and 588 pixels at 150 {GHz.} The {SPTpol} design has several features designed to control polarization systematics, including: singlemoded feedhorns with low cross-polarization, bolometer pairs well-matched to dfference atmospheric signals, an improved ground shield design based on far-sidelobe measurements of the {SPT}, and a small beam to reduce temperature to polarization leakage. We present an overview of the {SPTpol} instrument design, project status, and science projections.},

to map the Cosmic Microwave Background’s polarization. We have been able to rapidly deploy these detectors because
they are completely planar with an integrated phased-array antenna. Through our experience in these experiments, we
have learned of several challenges with this technology- specifically the beam synthesis in the antenna- and in this paper
we report on how we have modified our designs to mitigate these challenges. In particular, we discus differential steering
errors between the polarization pairs’ beam centroids due to microstrip cross talk and gradients of penetration depth in the
niobium thin films of our millimeter wave circuits. We also discuss how we have suppressed side lobe response with a
Gaussian taper of our antenna illumination pattern. These improvements will be used in Spider, Polar-1, and this season’s
retrofit of Keck Array.},

We have made use of the wellknown fact that the temperature coefficient of resistance of certain commercial carbon resistors is extremely large at low temperatures. Since the specific heat at these temperatures is small, it has proven to be relatively simple to construct a detector with a time constant of the order of milliseconds and a signal-to-noise figure surpassing any other known thermal detector of radiation. Furthermore the resistivity of the material is such that most of the radiation striking the surface is absorbed even at frequencies in the far infrared. A brief discussion of the noise to be expected under nonequilibrium conditions is given. In practice it is found that current noise is about an order of magnitude larger than all other sources of noise.},

The introduction sketches the history of modern bolometers, indicates how they fit into the more general class of thermal detectors, and describes the types of applications for which they are the optimum solution. Section I is a tutorial introduction to the elementary theories of bolometer response, of thermal radiation, and of bolometernoise. Important results are derived from the laws of thermal physics in the simplest possible way. The more rigorous theories of bolometer response and noise that are required for quantitative understanding and optimization are then summarized. This material is intended to provide the background required by workers who wish to choose the appropriate bolometer technology for a given measurement, or to evaluate a novel technology. Section {II}, then describes the various components of an efficient bolometer and gives details of the fabrication and performance of modern bolometers. This discussion focuses on composite bolometers with semiconducting thermometers for operation at and below liquid heliumtemperatures. The tradeoffs involved in using superconductingthermometers at low temperatures are discussed. Finally, a discussion is given of bolometers for operation at liquid nitrogen temperature which use the new {high‐T} c superconductors as thermometers.},

I describe a technique for rigorously calculating thermal photon noise, which allows for arbitrary numbers of optical inputs and detectors, multiple-mode illumination, and both internal and external noise sources. Several simple examples are given, and a general result is obtained for multimode detectors. The formalism uses scattering matrices, noise correlation matrices, and some fundamentals of quantum optics. The covariance matrix of the photon noise at the detector outputs is calculated and includes the Hanbury Brown and Twiss photon-bunching correlations. These correlations can be of crucial importance, and they explain why instruments such as autocorrelation spectrometers and pairwise-combined interferometers are competitive (and indeed common) at radio wavelengths but have a sensitivity disadvantage at optical wavelengths. The case of autocorrelation spectrometers is studied in detail.},

All samples were usefully transparent at millimeter-wave frequencies (up to 300 {GHz} ) based on a 3 {dB} criterion, but became progressively opaque at higher frequencies in a highly sample-dependent manner. This is explained by the samples becoming “optically dense” in the {THz} region, so that the transmission becomes exponentially dependent on sample thickness. The attenuation in the {IR} region is very high ( ⩾ 25 {dB} ) except in two samples (rayon and nylon), whose exceptional transparency (e.g., − 12 {dB} in nylon) is attributed to pores intrinsic to the material.},

Practical instruments often require a complex optimization among speed, linearity and energy resolution. However, a lack of understanding of the superconducting transition limits our ability to predict the behavior of a new {TES} design. Specifically, there is an unmet need for a model that predicts the current and temperature dependent resistance surface that describes the transition: R({I,T).} This paper describes the predictions of a two-fluid model for the resistance of a {TES} based on a Ginzburg-Landau form of the critical current. We compare the predictions of the model for the logarithmic derivatives of resistance with temperature and current (α and β) to measurements of {TESs} used in x-ray and gamma spectrometers. The model shows excellent qualitative agreement that provides useful insight into the dependence of α and β on the current density and bias point of the {TES.}},
