In this sensor, the temperature of a superconducting film is held constant by feeding back to its position on the resistive transition edge. Energy deposited in the film is measured by a reduction in the feedback Joule heating. This mode of operation should lead to substantial improvements in resolution, linearity, dynamic range, and count rate. Fundamental resolution limits are below {ΔE=√kT} 2 C, which is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the thermodynamic limit. This performance is better than any existing technology operating at the same temperature, count rate, and absorber heat capacity. Applications include high resolution x‐ray spectrometry, dark matter searches, and neutrino detection.},

	abstract = {In recent years, superconducting transition-edge sensors ({TES)} have emerged as powerful, energyresolving detectors of single photons from the near infrared through gamma rays and sensitive detectors of photon fluxes out to millimeter wavelengths. The {TES} is a thermal sensor that measures an energy deposition by the increase of resistance of a superconducting film biased within the superconducting-to-normal transition. Small arrays of {TES} sensors have been demonstrated, and kilopixel arrays are under development. In this chapter, we describe the theory of the superconducting phase transition, derive the {TES} calorimeter response and noise theory, discuss the state of understanding of excess noise, and describe practical implementation issues including materials choice, pixel design, array fabrication, and cryogenic {SQUID} multiplexing.},

The demodulated {TOD} is stable on time scales of 500-1000 seconds, corresponding to frequencies of 1-2 {mHz.} This facilitates recovery of cosmological information at large angular scales, which are typically available only from balloon-borne or satellite experiments. This technique also achieves a sensitive measurement of celestial polarization without differencing the {TOD} of paired detectors sensitive to two orthogonal linear polarizations. This is the first demonstration of the ability to remove atmospheric contamination at these levels from a ground-based platform using a rapidly-rotating {HWP.}},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2101},
	abstract = {Observations of the temperature anisotropy of the Cosmic Microwave Background ({CMB)} lend support to an inflationary origin of the universe, yet no direct evidence verifying inflation exists. Many current experiments are focussing on the {CMB's} polarization anisotropy, specifically its curl component (called {"B-mode"} polarization), which remains undetected. The inflationary paradigm predicts the existence of a primordial gravitational wave background that imprints a unique B-mode signature on the {CMB's} polarization at large angular scales. The {CMB} B-mode signal also encodes gravitational lensing information at smaller angular scales, bearing the imprint of cosmological large scale structures ({LSS)} which in turn may elucidate the properties of cosmological neutrinos. The quest for detection of these signals; each of which is orders of magnitude smaller than the {CMB} temperature anisotropy signal, has motivated the development of background-limited detectors with precise control of systematic effects. The {POLARBEAR} experiment is designed to perform a deep search for the signature of gravitational waves from inflation and to characterize lensing of the {CMB} by {LSS.} {POLARBEAR} is a 3.5 meter ground-based telescope with 3.8 arcminute angular resolution at 150 {GHz.} At the heart of the {POLARBEAR} receiver is an array featuring 1274 antenna-coupled superconducting transition edge sensor ({TES)} bolometers cooled to 0.25 Kelvin. {POLARBEAR} is designed to reach a tensor-to-scalar ratio of 0.025 after two years of observation -- more than an order of magnitude improvement over the current best results, which would test physics at energies near the {GUT} scale. {POLARBEAR} had an engineering run in the Inyo Mountains of Eastern California in 2010 and will begin observations in the Atacama Desert in Chile in 2011.},

The receiver contains a focal plane of 280 superconducting transition-edge sensor ({TES)} bolometers instrumented with a frequency-domain multiplexed readout system. The bolometers are cooled to 280 {mK} via a three-stage helium sorption refrigerator and a mechanical pulse-tube cooler. Three warm mirrors, two 4 K lenses, and a horn array couple the {TES} bolometers to the telescope. {APEX-SZ} observes in a single frequency band at 150 {GHz} with 1′ angular resolution and a 22′ field-of-view, all well suited for cluster mapping. The {APEX-SZ} receiver has played a key role in the introduction of several new technologies including {TES} bolometers, the frequency-domain multiplexed readout, and the use of a pulse-tube cooler with bolometers. As a result of these new technologies, the instrument has a higher instantaneous sensitivity and covers a larger field-of-view than earlier generations of Sunyaev-Zel\&apos;dovich instruments. The {TES} bolometers have a median sensitivity of 890 μ K {CMB} s ({NEy} of 3.5 × 10−4 s ). We have also demonstrated upgraded detectors with improved sensitivity of 530 μ K {CMB} s ({NEy} of 2.2 × 10−4 s ). Since its commissioning in April 2007, {APEX-SZ} has been used to map 48 clusters. We describe the design of the receiver and its performance when installed on the {APEX} telescope.},

With two imaging arrays working simultaneously in the atmospheric windows at 450 and 850 μm, the vast increase in pixel count means that {SCUBA-2} maps the sky 100–150 times faster than the previous {SCUBA} instrument. In this paper, we present an overview of the instrument, discuss the physical characteristics of the superconducting detector arrays, outline the observing modes and data acquisition, and present the early performance figures on the telescope. We also showcase the capabilities of the instrument via some early examples of the science {SCUBA-2} that have already been undertaken. In 2012 February, {SCUBA-2} began a series of unique legacy surveys for the {JCMT} community. These surveys will take 2.5 yr and the results are already providing complementary data to the shorter wavelength, shallower, larger area surveys from Herschel. The {SCUBA-2} surveys will also provide a wealth of information for further study with new facilities such as {ALMA}, and future telescopes such as {CCAT} and {SPICA.}},

	abstract = {{SPTpol} is a dual-frequency polarization-sensitive camera that was deployed on the 10-meter South Pole Telescope in January 2012. {SPTpol} will measure the polarization anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background ({CMB)} on angular scales spanning an arcminute to several degrees. The polarization sensitivity of {SPTpol} will enable a detection of the {CMB} {“B-mode”} polarization from the detection of the gravitational lensing of the {CMB} by large scale structure, and a detection or improved upper limit on a primordial signal due to inationary gravity waves. The two measurements can be used to constrain the sum of the neutrino masses and the energy scale of ination. These science goals can be achieved through the polarization sensitivity of the {SPTpol} camera and careful control of systematics. The {SPTpol} camera consists of 768 pixels, each containing two transition-edge sensor ({TES)} bolometers coupled to orthogonal polarizations, and a total of 1536 bolometers. The pixels are sensitive to light in one of two frequency bands centered at 90 and 150 {GHz}, with 180 pixels at 90 {GHz} and 588 pixels at 150 {GHz.} The {SPTpol} design has several features designed to control polarization systematics, including: singlemoded feedhorns with low cross-polarization, bolometer pairs well-matched to dfference atmospheric signals, an improved ground shield design based on far-sidelobe measurements of the {SPT}, and a small beam to reduce temperature to polarization leakage. We present an overview of the {SPTpol} instrument design, project status, and science projections.},

to map the Cosmic Microwave Background’s polarization. We have been able to rapidly deploy these detectors because
they are completely planar with an integrated phased-array antenna. Through our experience in these experiments, we
have learned of several challenges with this technology- specifically the beam synthesis in the antenna- and in this paper
we report on how we have modified our designs to mitigate these challenges. In particular, we discus differential steering
errors between the polarization pairs’ beam centroids due to microstrip cross talk and gradients of penetration depth in the
niobium thin films of our millimeter wave circuits. We also discuss how we have suppressed side lobe response with a
Gaussian taper of our antenna illumination pattern. These improvements will be used in Spider, Polar-1, and this season’s
retrofit of Keck Array.},

We have made use of the wellknown fact that the temperature coefficient of resistance of certain commercial carbon resistors is extremely large at low temperatures. Since the specific heat at these temperatures is small, it has proven to be relatively simple to construct a detector with a time constant of the order of milliseconds and a signal-to-noise figure surpassing any other known thermal detector of radiation. Furthermore the resistivity of the material is such that most of the radiation striking the surface is absorbed even at frequencies in the far infrared. A brief discussion of the noise to be expected under nonequilibrium conditions is given. In practice it is found that current noise is about an order of magnitude larger than all other sources of noise.},

The introduction sketches the history of modern bolometers, indicates how they fit into the more general class of thermal detectors, and describes the types of applications for which they are the optimum solution. Section I is a tutorial introduction to the elementary theories of bolometer response, of thermal radiation, and of bolometernoise. Important results are derived from the laws of thermal physics in the simplest possible way. The more rigorous theories of bolometer response and noise that are required for quantitative understanding and optimization are then summarized. This material is intended to provide the background required by workers who wish to choose the appropriate bolometer technology for a given measurement, or to evaluate a novel technology. Section {II}, then describes the various components of an efficient bolometer and gives details of the fabrication and performance of modern bolometers. This discussion focuses on composite bolometers with semiconducting thermometers for operation at and below liquid heliumtemperatures. The tradeoffs involved in using superconductingthermometers at low temperatures are discussed. Finally, a discussion is given of bolometers for operation at liquid nitrogen temperature which use the new {high‐T} c superconductors as thermometers.},

I describe a technique for rigorously calculating thermal photon noise, which allows for arbitrary numbers of optical inputs and detectors, multiple-mode illumination, and both internal and external noise sources. Several simple examples are given, and a general result is obtained for multimode detectors. The formalism uses scattering matrices, noise correlation matrices, and some fundamentals of quantum optics. The covariance matrix of the photon noise at the detector outputs is calculated and includes the Hanbury Brown and Twiss photon-bunching correlations. These correlations can be of crucial importance, and they explain why instruments such as autocorrelation spectrometers and pairwise-combined interferometers are competitive (and indeed common) at radio wavelengths but have a sensitivity disadvantage at optical wavelengths. The case of autocorrelation spectrometers is studied in detail.},

All samples were usefully transparent at millimeter-wave frequencies (up to 300 {GHz} ) based on a 3 {dB} criterion, but became progressively opaque at higher frequencies in a highly sample-dependent manner. This is explained by the samples becoming “optically dense” in the {THz} region, so that the transmission becomes exponentially dependent on sample thickness. The attenuation in the {IR} region is very high ( ⩾ 25 {dB} ) except in two samples (rayon and nylon), whose exceptional transparency (e.g., − 12 {dB} in nylon) is attributed to pores intrinsic to the material.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a calibrated broadband emitter for the millimeter-wave through terahertz frequency regime, called the aqueous blackbody calibration source. Due to its extremely high absorption, liquid water is chosen as the emitter on the basis of reciprocity. The water is constrained to a specific shape (an optical trap geometry) in an expanded polystyrene ({EPS)} container and maintained at a selected, uniform temperature. Uncertainty in the selected radiometric temperature due to the undesirable reflectance present at a water interface is minimized by the trap geometry, ensuring that radiation incident on the entrance aperture encounters a pair of s and a pair of p reflections at 45°. For water reflectance Rw of 40\% at 45° in W-band, this implies a theoretical effective aperture emissivity of ({1−R2wsR2wp){\textgreater}98.8\%.} From W-band to 450 {GHz}, the maximum radiometric temperature uncertainty is ±0.40 K, independent of water temperature. Uncertainty from 450 {GHz} to 1 {THz} is increased due to {EPS} scattering and absorption, resulting in a maximum uncertainty of −3 K at 1 {THz.}},

The driving attributes in this field are essentially the transparency of clothing for security scanning and the transparency of fog, cloud, rain and dust for all weather flight. Out-door illumination and the physics of the interaction of millimetre waves with the atmosphere and obscurants are discussed, together with the interaction of millimetre waves with multi layer material surfaces, giving rise to transmission, reflection and emission. The physics of these interactions are discussed in the context of computer graphics. These considerations enable a powerful polarimetric modelling capability to be developed that can be used to simulate all scenarios, including artificial or burst illumination, from in-doors to imaging from satellites.},

Limitations will be examined, considering effects such as the absorption in the atmosphere, various materials, the human body and fundamental radiometric noise limitations. The physics behind these considerations will be examined and results and artefacts presented using scene simulation. Conclusions are that above 500 {GHz} high atmospheric absorption severely limits imager to subject distances to a few hundred metres. The effect of absorption is poor subject illumination and high signal attenuation between the subject and the imager. These limitations may be over come partially, for short imager to subject distances (less than a few hundred metres), by using active illumination with narrow bandwidth radiation sources. However, transmit powers rise steeply with imager to subject distance and radiation frequency, lying typically between 1 {mW} and 1 W over the frequency band 500 {GHz} to 1 {THz}, for a radiation bandwidth of 1 {GHz} and an imager to subject distance of 20 m. Similar systems analysis for medical applications indicates that the high attenuation in human tissue limits probing or penetration distances of the radiation. Radiometric photon noise, electrical properties of human tissue and irradiation power restrictions (1 {mW/cm2)} limit maximum diagnostic depths to between two and one millimetres between the frequencies of 100 {GHz} and 1 {THz.}},

Practical instruments often require a complex optimization among speed, linearity and energy resolution. However, a lack of understanding of the superconducting transition limits our ability to predict the behavior of a new {TES} design. Specifically, there is an unmet need for a model that predicts the current and temperature dependent resistance surface that describes the transition: R({I,T).} This paper describes the predictions of a two-fluid model for the resistance of a {TES} based on a Ginzburg-Landau form of the critical current. We compare the predictions of the model for the logarithmic derivatives of resistance with temperature and current (α and β) to measurements of {TESs} used in x-ray and gamma spectrometers. The model shows excellent qualitative agreement that provides useful insight into the dependence of α and β on the current density and bias point of the {TES.}},

These models assist with our understanding of the behaviour of these filters when used at non-normal incidence or in the diffraction region of the grid structures.

An important consequence is the significant increase in thermal loading on the cryogens and in the stray thermal emission reaching the detectors. We have identified that a significant part of this unwanted radiation comes from re-emission of thermal power absorbed by the dielectric substrate of the metal mesh rejection filters. To overcome this we have developed a thermal filter, which preferentially reflects radiation near the 10μm thermal peak. These filters have essentially no absorption, and hence negligible emission, at these wavelengths whilst allowing high transmission of the wanted sub-millimetre bands. We report here on thermal problems with existing metal mesh filter technology and give performance data for the new filters. As a proof of concept we present data for a medium aperture instrument ({QUaD1)}, which utilises a 200mm diameter window, both with and without thermal filters.},

from the Atacama desert in Chile. For the first observing season one array of 32 x 32 Transition Edge

({MBAC).} In the next season, three independent arrays working at 145, 220 and 280 {GHz} will be installed in

{MBAC.} The three bolometer arrays are each coupled to a time-domain multiplexer developed at the National

Institute of Standard and Technology, Boulder, which comprises three stages of superconducting quantum

Electronics ({MCE)} developed at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver.

A number of experiments plan to use the {MCE} as read-out electronics and thus the procedure for tuning the

three stage {SQUID} system is of general interest. Here we describe the automated array tuning procedures and

algorithms we have developed. During array tuning, the {SQUIDs} are biased near their critical currents. {SQUID}

feedback currents and lock points are selected to maximize linearity, dynamic range, and gain of the {SQUID}

response curves. Our automatic array characterization optimizes the tuning of all three stages of {SQUIDs} by

selecting over 1100 parameters per array during the first observing season and over 2100 parameters during the

second observing season. We discuss the timing, performance, and reliability of this array tuning procedure

as well as planned and recently implemented improvements.},

The design of the {SPT} emphasizes careful control of spillover and scattering, to minimize noise and false signals due to ground pickup. The key initial project is a large-area survey at wavelengths of 3, 2, and 1.3 mm, to detect clusters of galaxies via the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich effect and to measure the small-scale angular power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background ({CMB).} The data will be used to characterize the primordial matter power spectrum and to place constraints on the equation of state of dark energy. A second-generation camera will measure the polarization of the {CMB}, potentially leading to constraints on the neutrino mass and the energy scale of inflation.},

These devices are generally designed using computationally-intensive simulation to predict and optimize electromagnetic performance. The design process therefore requires access to expensive software and does not directly offer physical insight regarding why the detector operates as it does. This paper describes a fast, simple, and insightful analytical technique which applies to the design of absorber-coupled waveguide bolometer detectors operating in the micro- and millimeter-wavelength regimes. We provide simple analytical expressions for the detector input impedance, as well as the resistance and width of the dipole-like absorber, and describe a quick iterative method to determine the appropriate absorber length. The analysis is based upon the {EMF} Method, which provides a strong theoretical basis for understanding detector operation. We also describe experimental results for an absorber-coupled bolometer detector in circular waveguide.},

	abstract = {Kinetic Inductance Detectors ({KIDs)} provide a promising solution to the problem of producing large format arrays of ultra sensitive detectors for astronomy. Traditionally {KIDs} have been constructed from superconducting quarter-wavelength or half-wavelength resonator elements capacitivly coupled to a coplanar feed line. Photons are detected by measuring the change in quasi-particle density caused by the splitting of Cooper pairs in the superconducting resonant element. This change in quasi-particle density alters the kinetic inductance, and hence the resonant frequency of the resonant element. This arrangement requires the quasi-particles generated by photon absorption to be concentrated at positions of high current density in the resonator. This is usually achieved through antenna coupling or quasi-particle trapping. For these detectors to work at wavelengths shorter than around 500 m where antenna coupling can introduce a signicant loss of eciency, a direct absorption method needs to be considered. One solution to this problem is the Lumped Element {KID} ({LEKID)}, which shows no current variation along its length and can be arranged into a photon absorbing area coupled to free space and therefore requiring no antennas or quasi-particle trapping. The work throughout this thesis studies the properties of the {LEKID} device though simulation and experimental data and lays the foundation for developing an optimised detector using this direct absorption approach.},

Ardito et al. in http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ex/0501010, [2005]). The cryostat is ∼ 3 m high and has a diameter of ∼ 1.6 m. About 5 tons of lead shielding are to be cooled to below 1 K and a mass of 1.5 ton must be cooled to 10 {mK.} Some tie-rods sustain the different parts of the experiment. One end of each rod is at low temperature (10 {mK} for the detector frame, 50 {mK} for the coldest radiation shield, 700 {mK} for the shield linked to the still) with the other end usually at room temperature. A thermalization of the rods at the temperature of the first stage of the pulse tubes will be realized. Hence the value of the thermal conductivity of the material up to room temperature is important. At the lowest temperatures, the thermal conductivity has great influence in establishing the thermal load on the dilution refrigerator. The thermal conductivity of the structural material candidates for such tie-rods is usually known down to 4.2 K. Here we present data of thermal conductivity for the {Ti6Al4V} alloy below its superconductive transition temperature (4.38 K). A comparison over the full temperature range of operation is also done with other materials, such as 316 stainless steel and Torlon, candidates for the realization of the tie-rods.},

	abstract = {This book provides a broad and applications-oriented introduction to electromagnetic waves and antennas. Current interest in these areas is driven by the growth in wireless and fiber-optic communications, information technology, and materials science.

Communications, antenna, radar, and microwave engineers must deal with the generation, transmission, and reception of electromagnetic waves. Device engineers working on ever-smaller integrated circuits and at ever higher frequencies must take into account wave propagation effects at the chip and circuit-board levels. Communication and computer network engineers routinely use waveguiding systems, such as transmission lines and optical fibers. Novel recent developments in materials, such as photonic bandgap structures, omnidirectional dielectric mirrors, birefringent multilayer films, surface plasmons, negative-index metamaterials, slow and fast light, promise a revolution in the control and manipulation of light and other applications. These are just some examples of topics discussed in this book.

The book is organized around three main topic areas:

The propagation, reflection, and transmission of plane waves, and the analysis and design of multilayer films.
Waveguides, transmission lines, impedance matching, and S-parameters.
Linear and aperture antennas, scalar and vector diffraction theory, antenna array design, and coupled antennas.
The text emphasizes connections to other subjects. For example, the mathematical techniques for analyzing wave propagation in multilayer structures, multisegment transmission lines, and the design of multilayer optical filters are the same as those used in {DSP}, such as the lattice structures of linear prediction, the analysis and synthesis of speech, and geophysical signal processing. Similarly, antenna array design is related to the problem of spectral analysis of sinusoids and to digital filter design, and Butler beams are equivalent to the {FFT.}},

	abstract = {The thermal conductivity of vitreous {SiO2}, Se, and silica- and germania-based glasses has been measured between 0.05 and 100 {°K.} Comparison with earlier work on noncrystalline solids shows that they all have the same conductivity within a factor of 5 over the entire temperature range investigated, with the same characteristic plateau around 10 {°K}, and that their conductivity varies as Tn, n∼1.8, below {T=1°K.} Furthermore, the average phonon mean free path is large by comparison with the phonon wavelength, about 10−4 cm at 2 {°K} and decreasing as T−4 at larger T, suggesting a Rayleigh-type scattering mechanism. Such a mean free path can be quantitatively explained by approximating the glassy structure with that of a crystal in which every atom is displaced from its lattice site. Then every atom scatters like an interstitial atom, or—even simpler—like one that is missing at its regular lattice site, with a scattering cross section determined by the missing mass (isotopic defect). The specific heat of amorphous {SiO2}, {GeO2}, and Se has been found to vary as {AT+BT3} between 0.1 and 1 {°K}, with A=10 erg/g {°K2} within a factor of 2. This departure from the Debye specific heat may be characteristic of the glassy state, as all earlier measurements of other glasses [polystyrene, glycerol, Lucite ({PMMA)]} indicate a similar anomaly. Its origin is not clear. Impurities or surface effects through adsorbed gases are unlikely because of the many samples and experimental techniques used in different laboratories. We have tried to attribute the anomaly to low-lying electronic states, motional states of ions, trapped atoms or large groups of atoms, or one-dimensional vibrations within a three-dimensional solid, so far without success. At the present time, the only independent evidence for these excitations appears to be in the low-temperature thermal conductivity at T{\textless}1 {°K} described above.},

In fact, it is shown that the temperature scale corrections, necessary to correct the data to the simple law given above, essentially agree with temperature scale corrections suggested by other work. Values of the coefficient of the linear term (electron heat capacity) and the Debye characteristic temperature have been derived and compared with several indirect determinations, as well as with other calorimetric data, where possible.

The thermal conductivity has a temperature dependence often seen in amorphous solids, but the magnitude is large, with the expected plateau occurring at significantly higher temperatures than seen in other amorphous systems. Specific heat measurements show that the expected ‘peak’ in the vibrational spectrum also occurs at relatively high temperatures. The estimated phonon mean-free-path at 300 K is ≈5 Å, comparable to the inter-atomic spacing, as seen in other amorphous solids. Below ≈ 20 K the mean free path is comparable to or exceeds the thickness of the membrane, indicating that surface scattering dominates the thermal transport. This surface scattering is found to be either specular or diffuse, depending on details of the membrane processing, which affects both the thermal conductivity and specific heat below 10 K.},

To optimize the radar's range resolution, a reliable software calibration procedure compensates for signal distortion from radar waveform nonlinearities.

	abstract = {The useful compromise between resolution and penetration power of the submillimeter or terahertz ({THz)} spectral region has long made it attractive for a variety of imaging applications. However, many of the demonstrations of imaging in this spectral region have used strategically oriented targets, especially favorable concealment materials, proximate imaging geometries, etc. This paper reports the results of studies aimed at better understanding the phenomenology of targets, the impact of this phenomenology on various active and passive imaging strategies, and most importantly, the development of imaging strategies that do not require the aforementioned special circumstances. Particular attention is paid to the relationship between active and passive images, especially with respect to how they interact with the illumination- and detector-mode structures of various imaging scenarios. It is concluded that the very large dynamic range that can be obtained with active single-mode systems (including focal-plane arrays) can be used in system designs to overcome the deleterious effects that result from the dominance of specular reflections in single-mode active systems as well as to strategically orient targets to obtain recognition. This will aid in the development of a much more robust and generally useful imaging technology in this spectral region.},

	title = {Planck 2013 results. I. Overview of products and scientific results},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5062},
	abstract = {The {ESA's} Planck satellite, dedicated to studying the early universe, was launched on May 2009 and has been surveying the microwave and submillimetre sky since August 2009. In March 2013, {ESA} and the Planck Collaboration publicly released the initial cosmology products based on the first 15.5 months of Planck operations, along with a set of scientific and technical papers and a web-based explanatory supplement. This paper describes the mission and its performance, and gives an overview of the processing and analysis of the data, the characteristics of the data, the main scientific results, and the science data products and papers in the release. Scientific results include robust support for the standard, six parameter {LCDM} model of cosmology and improved measurements for the parameters that define this model, including a highly significant deviation from scale invariance of the primordial power spectrum. The Planck values for some of these parameters and others derived from them are significantly different from those previously determined. Several large scale anomalies in the {CMB} temperature distribution detected earlier by {WMAP} are confirmed with higher confidence. Planck sets new limits on the number and mass of neutrinos, and has measured gravitational lensing of {CMB} anisotropies at 25 sigma. Planck finds no evidence for non-Gaussian statistics of the {CMB} anisotropies. There is some tension between Planck and {WMAP} results; this is evident in the power spectrum and results for some of the cosmology parameters. In general, Planck results agree well with results from the measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations. Because the analysis of Planck polarization data is not yet as mature as the analysis of temperature data, polarization results are not released. We do, however, illustrate the robust detection of the E-mode polarization signal around {CMB} hot- and cold-spots.},

The filling factor of the mesh is small, providing a small heat capacity and a low geometric cross-section to cosmic rays. The mesh is patterned from a free-standing silicon nitride membrane and is thermally isolated by long radial legs of silicon nitride. A thin metallic film evaporated on the mesh absorbs radiation by matching the surface impedance to that of free space. A neutron transmutation doped germanium thermistor attached to the center of the mesh detects the temperature increase from absorbed radiation. The low thermal conductivity and heat capacity of silicon nitride provide improved performance in low background applications. We discuss the theoretical limits of the performance of these devices. We have tested a device at 300 {mK} with an {electricalNEP=4×10−17} W Hz−1/2 and a time constant τ=40 ms.},

	abstract = {We present a model of the longwave atmospheric spectrum that improves in many respects widely used older models such as the microwave propagation model ({MPM)}, since it is based on broadband measurements and calculations. According to our data, the model is fully applicable from 0 to 2 {THz} while including lines up to 10 {THz.} Its primary goal is to simulate the millimeter/submillimeter region accessible from the ground (frequencies up to 2 {THz} at most, with a few windows between 1 and 2 {THz} accessible only under exceptional conditions at very dry sites). Line-by-line calculations of the absorption are performed using a line database generated from the latest available spectroscopic constants for all relevant atmospheric species. The collisional line widths are obtained from published laboratory data. The excess of absorption in the longwave range that cannot be explained by the line spectrum is modeled by introducing two different continuum-like terms based on {FTS} measurements between 170 and 1100 {GHz:} collision-induced absorption of the dry atmosphere due to transient dipoles in symmetric molecules (N 2 and O2) and continuum-like water vapor opacity. All {H2O} lines up to 10 {THz} are included in order to correctly account for the entire {H2O} far-wing opacity below 2 {THz} for a given line-shape. Hence, this contribution does not need to be part of a pseudocontinuum term below that frequency cutoff (still necessary, as shown in this paper) in contrast to other models used to date. Phase delays near {H2O} and O2 resonances are also important for ground-based astronomy since they affect interferometric phase. The frequency-dependent dispersive phase delay function is formally related to the absorption line shape via the Kramers-Kronig dispersion theory, and this relation has been used for modeling those delays. Precise calculations of phase delays are essential for the future Atacama large millimeter array ({ALMA)} project. A software package called atmospheric transmission at microwaves ({ATM)} has been developed to provide the radioastronomy and aeronomy communities with an updated tool to compute the atmospheric spectrum in clear-sky conditions for various scientific applications. We use this model to provide detailed simulations of atmospheric transmission and phase dispersion for several sites suitable for submillimeter astronomy},

	abstract = {A novel cylindrical millimeter-wave imaging technique has been developed at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory for the detection of metallic and non-metallic concealed weapons. This technique uses a vertical array of millimeter- wave antennas which is mechanically swept around a person in a cylindrical fashion. The wideband millimeter-wave data is mathematically reconstructed into a series of high- resolution images of the person being screened. Clothing is relatively transparent to millimeter-wave illumination,whereas the human body and concealed items are reflective at millimeter wavelengths. Differences in shape and reflectivity are revealed in the images and allow a human operator to detect and identify concealed weapons. A full 360 degree scan is necessary to fully inspect a person for concealed items. The millimeter-wave images can be formed into a video animation sequence in which the person appears to rotate in front of a fixed illumination {source.This} is s convenient method for presenting the {3D} image data for analysis. This work has been fully sponsored by the {FAA.} An engineering prototype based on the cylindrical imaging technique is presently under development. The {FAA} is currently opposed to presenting the image data directly to the operator due to personal privacy concerns. A computer automated system is desired to address this problem by eliminating operator viewing of the imagery.},

	abstract = {It is well known that millimetre–wave systems can penetrate poor weather, dust and smoke far better than infrared or visible systems. Imaging in this band offers the opportunity to be able to navigate and perform surveillance in these conditions of poor visibility. Furthermore, the ability to penetrate dielectrics such as plastic and cloth has opened up the opportunity of detecting weapons and contraband hidden under people's clothing. The optical properties of materials have a direct impact on the applicability of imaging systems. In the terahertz band solids have absorptions which can be assigned to vibrational modes. Lattice modes occur at the lowest frequencies and polythene, for example, has a lattice mode at 2.4 {THz.} Solids have no such absorptions in the millimetre bands (30–300 {GHz)} and image contrast is produced by differences in transmission, reflection and absorption.
A novel, real–time, mechanically scanned, passive millimetre–wave imager has been designed. The antenna elements are based on a combination of a Schmidt camera and a conical scanner, both of which have their origins in optical systems.

	abstract = {Terahertz ({THz)} technology is one of emerging technologies that will change our life. A lot of attractive applications in security, medicine, biology, astronomy, and non-destructive materials testing have been demonstrated already. However, the realization of {THz} emitters and receivers is a challenge because the frequencies are too high for conventional electronics and the photon energies are too small for classical optics. As a result, {THz} radiation is resistant to the techniques commonly employed in these well established neighbouring bands. In the paper, issues associated with the development and exploitation of {THz} radiation detectors and focal plane arrays are discussed. Historical impressive progress in {THz} detector sensitivity in a period of more than half century is analyzed. More attention is put on the basic physical phenomena and the recent progress in both direct and heterodyne detectors. After short description of general classification of {THz} detectors, more details concern Schottky barrier diodes, pair braking detectors, hot electron mixers and field-effect transistor detectors, where links between {THz} devices and modern technologies such as micromachining are underlined. Also, the operational conditions of {THz} detectors and their upper performance limits are reviewed. Finally, recent advances in novel nanoelectronic materials and technologies are described. It is expected that applications of nanoscale materials and devices will open the door for further performance improvement in {THz} detectors.},

leverages previously reported device scaling to increase sensitivity. We
present a radiometer module designed for 60 {GHz} {RF} bandwidth that
utilizes {HRL's} antimonide-based backward tunnel diode. An impedance
matching circuit with on- and off-chip elements, as well as ridged
waveguide, provides a wideband match to the detectors. Modules were
designed with two different microwave substrates: 125 micron thick
quartz and 100 micron thick alumina. flip-chip bonding of the detectors
is amenable to automated pick-and-place for high volume manufacturing.
The modular nature of the array approach allows large arrays to be
manufactured in a straightforward manner. We present the design approach

As current detectors of the cosmic microwave background ({CMB)} already have sensitivities comparable to the noise arising from the random arrival of {CMB} photons, the further gains in sensitivity needed to probe the very early Universe will have to arise from large arrays. A similar situation is encountered at other wavelengths. Single-pixel X-ray detectors now have a resolving power of E {\textless} 5 {eV} for single 6-{keV} photons, and future X-ray astronomy missions anticipate the need for 1,000-pixel arrays. Here we report the demonstration of a superconducting detector that is easily fabricated and can readily be incorporated into such an array. Its sensitivity is already within an order of magnitude of that needed for {CMB} observations, and its energy resolution is similarly close to the targets required for future X-ray astronomy missions.},

	abstract = {Millimeter-wave ({MMW)} imaging systems are currently undergoing deployment World-wide for airport security screening applications. Security screening through {MMW} imaging is facilitated by the relatively good transmission of these wavelengths through common clothing materials. Given the long wavelength of operation (frequencies between 20 {GHz} to {\textasciitilde} 100 {GHz}, corresponding to wavelengths between 1.5 cm and 3 mm), existing systems are suited for close-range imaging only due to substantial diffraction effects associated with practical aperture diameters. The present and arising security challenges call for systems that are capable of imaging concealed threat items at stand-off ranges beyond 5 meters at near video frame rates, requiring substantial increase in operating frequency in order to achieve useful spatial resolution. The construction of such imaging systems operating at several hundred {GHz} has been hindered by the lack of submm-wave low-noise amplifiers. In this paper we summarize our efforts in developing a submm-wave video camera which utilizes cryogenic antenna-coupled microbolometers as detectors. Whilst superconducting detectors impose the use of a cryogenic system, we argue that the resulting back-end complexity increase is a favorable trade-off compared to complex and expensive room temperature submm-wave {LNAs} both in performance and system cost.},

Possible application scenarios demand sensitive, fast, flexible and high-quality imaging techniques. At present, best results are obtained by passive imaging using cryogenic microbolometers as radiation detectors. Building upon the concept of a passive submillimeter-wave stand-off video camera introduced previously, we present the evolution of this concept into a practical application-ready imaging device. This has been achieved using a variety of measures such as optimizing the detector parameters, improving the scanning mechanism, increasing the sampling speed, and enhancing the image generation software. The camera concept is based on a Cassegrain-type mirror optics, an optomechanical scanner, an array of 20 superconducting transition-edge sensors operated at a temperature of 450 to 650 {mK}, and a closed-cycle cryogen-free cooling system. The main figures of the system include: a frequency band of 350±40 {GHz}, an object distance of 7 to 10 m, a circular field of view of 1.05 m diameter, and a spatial resolution in the image center of 2 cm at 8.5 m distance, a noise equivalent temperature difference of 0.1 to 0.4 K, and a maximum frame rate of 10 Hz.},

	abstract = {Passive submillimeter wave imaging is a concept that has been in the focus of interest as a promising technology for security applications for a number of years. It utilizes the unique optical properties of submillimeter waves and promises an alternative to millimeter-wave and X-ray backscattering portals for personal security screening in particular. Possible application scenarios demand sensitive, fast, and fleixible high-quality imaging techniques. Considering the low radiometric contrast of indoor scenes in the submillimeter range, this objective calls for an extremely high detector sensitivity that can only be achieved using cooled detectors. Our approach to this task is a series of passives standoff video cameras for the 350 {GHz} band that represent an evolving concept and a continuous development since 2007. The cameras utilize arrays of superconducting transition-edge sensors ({TES)}, i.e. cryogenic microbolometers, as radiation detectors. The {TES} are operate at temperatures below {1K}, cooled by a closed-cycle cooling system, and coupled to superconducting readout electronics. By this means, background limited photometry ({BLIP)} mode is achieved providing the maximum possible signal to noise ratio. At video rates, this leads to a pixel {NETD} well below {1K.} The imaging system is completed by reflector optics based on free-form mirrors. For object distances of 3–10m, a field of view up to 2m height and a diffraction-limited spatial resolution in the order of 1–2cm is provided. Opto-mechanical scanning systems are part of the optical setup and capable frame rates up to 25 frames per second. Both spiraliform and linear scanning schemes have been developed.},

	shorttitle = {Principles of Optics},
	abstract = {Principles of Optics is one of the classic science books of the twentieth century, and probably the most influential book in optics published in the past 40 years. The new edition is the first ever thoroughly revised and expanded edition of this standard text. Among the new material, much of which is not available in any other optics text, is a section on the {CAT} scan (computerized axial tomography), which has revolutionized medical diagnostics. The book also includes a new chapter on scattering from inhomogeneous media which provides a comprehensive treatment of the theory of scattering of scalar as well as of electromagnetic waves, including the Born series and the Rytov series. The chapter also presents an account of the principles of diffraction tomography - a refinement of the {CAT} scan - to which Emil Wolf, one of the authors, has made a basic contribution by formulating in 1969 what is generally regarded to be the basic theorem in this field. The chapter also includes an account of scattering from periodic potentials and its connection to the classic subject of determining the structure of crystals from X-ray diffraction experiments, including accounts of von Laue equations, Bragg's law, the Ewald sphere of reflection and the Ewald limiting sphere, both generalized to continuous media. These topics, although originally introduced in connection with the theory of X-ray diffraction by crystals, have since become of considerable relevance to optics, for example in connection with deep holograms. Other new topics covered in this new edition include interference with broad-band light, which introduces the reader to an important phenomenon discovered relatively recently by Emil Wolf, namely the generation of shifts of spectral lines and other modifications of spectra of radiated fields due to the state of coherence of a source. There is also a section on the so-called Rayleigh-Sommerfield diffraction theory which, in recent times, has been finding increasing popularity among optical scientists. There are also several new appendices, including one on energy conservation in scalar wavefields, which is seldom discussed in books on optics. The new edition of this standard reference will continue to be invaluable to advanced undergraduates, graduate students and researchers working in most areas of optics.},

We present a new in-focal-plane code-division multiplexer that provides multiplexing elements with the required scalability. This code-division multiplexer uses compact lithographic modulation elements that simultaneously multiplex both signal outputs and superconducting transition-edge sensor ({TES)} detector bias voltages. It eliminates the shunt resistor used to voltage bias {TES} detectors, greatly reduces power dissipation, allows different dc bias voltages for each {TES}, and makes all elements sufficiently compact to fit inside the detector pixel area. These in-focal plane code-division multiplexers can be combined with multi-{GHz} readout based on superconducting microresonators to scale to even larger arrays.},

The model is based on recent {U.S.} Army {NVESD} sensor performance modeling technology that couples system design parameters to observer-sensor field performance by using the acquire methodology for weapon identification performance predictions. This {THz} model has been developed in support of the Defense Advanced Research Project Agencies' Terahertz Imaging Focal-Plane Technology ({TIFT)} program and is currently being used to guide the design and development of a 0.650 {THz} active-passive imaging system. This paper will describe the {THz} model in detail, provide and discuss initial modeling results for a prototype {THz} imaging system, and outline plans to calibrate and validate the model through human perception testing.},

Ultra-wideband swept frequency radar, using direct detection receivers, is implemented to achieve short radar range resolution . The system is capable of detecting a wide range of objects positioned in front of the body by interpretation of the scattered waveform. Threat detection is rendered autonomously by a neural network that processes the scattered polarimetric, depth domain radar waveforms. The system may be configured to alarm or reject certain classes of objects, allowing for the detection of specific or broad spectrum threats. The radar system is portable and manually steered by the operator to enable standoff monitoring of walking human targets in real time. A video feed provides the operator with a wide field of view that allows tracking of persons and greatly facilitates aiming of the sensor. Rapid (1 ms) radar sweep times and fast signal acquisition and processing are implemented to provide threat detection at video frame rates (30 fps). Performance parameters for the detection of hand-guns and simulated {PBIED} are presented for ranges up to 25 m.},

The design is based in a confocal Gregorian system where the nominal reflector surfaces are substituted by shaped surfaces to reduce the beam aberrations, while not increasing the manufacture cost of the reflector antenna. We also provide a set of useful design formulas for the design of this kind of reflector systems. The beam patterns obtained by the proposed designs are numerically calculated with the commercial software {GRASP} and compared with those obtained with previous approaches to the same problem, showing the better performance of the proposed solution.},

A key performance metric is the radar's ability to penetrate thick clothing to reveal concealed threats. Here we investigate the limitations of terahertz ({THz)} radar imaging in the regime of weak penetration, and present evidence that noise carried by the radar signal itself, rather than the receiver's thermal noise floor, is the limiting factor for imaging through thick clothing. This means that higher power sources or lower noise figure receivers at 675 {GHz} will not improve radar penetration. Rather, efforts in this direction should focus on lowering the {THz} source's phase noise through better back-end electronics architecture, or operating at lower frequencies at the cost of poorer image resolution.},

	abstract = {Active imaging can provide significantly larger signal margins in the millimeter-wave spectral region than passive imaging, especially indoors—an important application for which there is no cold sky illumination. However, coherent effects, such as speckle, negate much of this advantage by destroying image clarity and target recognition. Moreover, active imaging demonstrations often use strategically chosen target orientations to optimally reflect power from the active illuminator back to the imaging receiver. In this paper we will discuss and show experimental results for a new active imaging approach that largely eliminates coherent effects and the need for optimized target orientation. The work described uses a synthesized harmonic multiplier chain to drive a 5 W extended interaction klystron at 218.4 {GHz}, a mechanical mode mixer to illuminate and modulate many modes, and a heterodyne receiver coupled into a 60 cm scanning mirror. Large signal margins were obtained in this ∼50  m range work, showing paths to imaging at ∼1  km, imaging with considerably less powerful illuminators, and the use of focal plane arrays.},

The review is not intended to be the definitive history of the field, but may form the basis for someone to later write a more comprehensive or encyclopedic version. The history conveniently divides into three periods: 1890 through World War {II}, Post War (1947 to 1965), and Modern Age (after 1965).},

Terahertz time-domain waveforms are downconverted from the terahertz to the kilohertz frequency range, and the waveform for each pixel is frequency analyzed in real time with a digital signal processor to extract compositional information at that point. We demonstrate applications to package inspection and chemical content mapping in biological objects.},

	abstract = {Development of focal plane arrays started in seventies last century and has revolutionized imaging systems in the next decades. This paper presents progress in optical detector technology of focal plane arrays during the past twenty years. At the beginning of paper, emphasises are given on integrated detector assembly and cooling requirements of different types of detectors. Next, the classification of two types of detectors (photon detectors and thermal detectors) is done on the basis of their principle of operation. This topic is followed by general overview of focal plane array architectures.
The main subject of paper is concentrated on describing of material systems and detectors operated in different spectral ranges. Special attention is given on recent progress in their detector technologies. Discussion is focused mainly on current and the most rapidly developing focal plane arrays including: {CdZnTe} detectors, {AlGaN} photodiodes, visible {CCD} and {CMOS} imaging systems, {HgCdTe} heterostructure photodiodes, quantum well {AlGaAs/GaAs} photoresistors, and thermal detectors. Emphasis is also given on far-infrared and sub-millimetre wave detector arrays. Finally, the outlook for near-future trends in optical detector technologies is presented.},

	abstract = {The detection of far-infrared (far-{IR)} and sub-mm-wave radiation is resistant to the commonly employed techniques in the neighbouring microwave and {IR} frequency bands. In this wavelength detection range the use of solid state detectors has been hampered for the reasons of transit time of charge carriers being larger than the time of one oscillation period of radiation. Also the energy of radiation quanta is substantially smaller than the thermal energy at room temperature and even liquid nitrogen temperature. The realization of terahertz ({THz)} emitters and receivers is a challenge because the frequencies are too high for conventional electronics and the photon energies are too small for classical optics. Development of semiconductor focal plane arrays started in seventies last century and has revolutionized imaging systems in the next decades. This paper presents progress in far-{IR} and sub-mm-wave semiconductor detector technology of focal plane arrays during the past twenty years. Special attention is given on recent progress in the detector technologies for real-time uncooled {THz} focal plane arrays such as Schottky barrier arrays, field-effect transistor detectors, and microbolometers. Also cryogenically cooled silicon and germanium extrinsic photoconductor arrays, and semiconductor bolometer arrays are considered.},
