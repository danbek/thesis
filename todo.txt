To Do:
* figure showing why circular fov from circular scan?
* deal with section 5.1
* ch4 - scale bars for optics figures?
* ch4 - carbon fiber tube cryogenic properties and references
* ch3 - add TES resistor to diagram? You know the one ...
* ch7 - LN2 temp in Boulder?
* ch7 - chapter wrap-up "Wrap up the chapter with a summary of what you have done and learned here, and the state of the video imaging."
* ch7 - quantify extent of misalignment needed to produce this ellipticity

Done:
* ch3 - explain all terms at point of use rather than waiting for table
* ch4 - aperture-stop discussion is confusing.
* ch8 - nils edits
* ch8 - ken edits
* ch1 - nick edits
* ch6 - Dad edits
* explain what RC notation means prior to use in Ch 3
* ch1 - dad edits
* ch1 - rework intro paragraphs
* extra solidworks screen-shots into ch 5
* nils ch 6 edits

not a to-do, but Nils idea: You should experiment with alignment errors in the zemax model to see if you can reproduce and better understand the beam ellipticity and plate scale problems that you measure. 

Another Nils comment: Keep in mind that if you are calculating sensitivity to a point source (where resolution matters), then you will lose senstivity as you make the feed larger, since you will illuminated a decreasing portion of the primary, reducing resolution. See Griffin, Bock, & Gear.
