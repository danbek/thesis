\chapter{System Specifications and Solutions}\label{c:specs}

The \Imager's specifications are intended to allow the system to serve as a ``gold standard'' for investigating the phenomenology of passive video imaging.
It is intended to be used to take images of a variety of concealed weapons and other objects, hidden beneath many different types of clothing, in both indoor and outdoor scenarios.
The goal is to gain a thorough understanding of trade-offs in terms of video frame rate, image resolution, and noise should be made in the design of future systems for use is specific operational scenarios.

To that end, the system has been designed to be able to achieve high resolution images with \NETD\ that is limited by photon noise.
This chapter describes the specifications for the \Imager, and summarized the technology approach taken to meet those specifications.

\section{Specifications} \label{sec:ch2-specifications}

The first goal of the \Imager\ is to achieve uncompromised noise performance through the use of a large number of photon-noise-limited detectors.
As discussed below, this requires the use of detectors at cryogenic temperatures.
We have chosen to use 1004 Transition Edge Sensor (\TES) bolometers as the detectors.
As discussed in \chapterref{c:det-design}, the system will include four 251-detector sub-arrays.
This thesis discusses results using only one these four sub-arrays.

The atmospheric window at \abt{\SI{350}{\GHz}} (\abt{\SI{860}{\um}}) was chosen for the optical band.
As can be seen from \figref{fig:ch1-clothes-atmos-trans}, this band is a nice trade-off between transmission through the atmosphere and clothing (which favors lower frequencies) and spatial resolution (which favors higher frequencies).
A \SI{35}{\GHz} full-width-half-maximum (\FWHM) band was chosen to fit within this atmospheric window.

The design standoff distances from the observed target is \SIrange{16}{28}{\m}, configurable by changing the distance between the cryostat containing the detectors and the rest of the optical system.
This distance was chosen to provide some separation from observation targets such as a suicide bomber, without requiring an unreasonably large optical aperture.
A very nice spatial resolution at \SI{16}{\m} standoff would be \SI{1}{\cm}.
At the center wavelength of the observation band of $\lambda_0 = \SI{863}{\um}$ (see \sectionref{sec:ch4-filters}), using the Raleigh criterion \eqnref{eqn:ch1-raleigh} leads to a required aperture size of
\begin{equation}
  D = 1.22 \times \SI{863}{\um} \times \frac{\SI{16}{\m}}{\SI{1}{\cm}} = \SI{1.7}{\m}.
\end{equation}
It was decided that a mirror of this size would be too expensive and large for this prototype system, so \SI{1.3}{\m} was chosen instead.
After accounting for the fact that the outer edge of the primary mirror is not illuminated (\sectionref{sec:ch4-optical-design}), the predicted resolution of the system is \SI{1.4}{\cm} (\sectionref{sec:ch4-feedhorn-design}).

Security applications can require observing a moving target, so that video frame-rates are needed.
Exactly how fast the frame-rate needs to be in order to support accurate tracking can vary on the scenario.
The components of the \Imager\ have all been designed to allow frame rates of up to 20 frames per second.
The targeted field of view is $\SI{1}{\m} \times \SI{1}{\m}$.

In order to achieve all of these requirement, other aspects of the system design were compromised.
In particular, the desire for high spatial resolution at longer standoff distances requires a large optical aperture, which increases the size of the system.
Although the system is mounted on rollers so that it can be moved within the lab or into other labs, the location at which it points can not be steered in real-time.
Additionally the focus distance can only be changed by reconfiguring the mounting structure that connects the cryostat to the optics.

\section{Transition Edge Sensor Bolometer Basics}

A bolometer detects optical power by measuring the temperature of an isolated object which absorbs the optical power.
\figref{fig:ch2-bolo-cartoon} shows a cartoon picture of a bolometer.
Optical power $P_{opt}$ falls onto an isolated absorbed with heat capacity $C$.
The optical power is thermalized in the absorber, causing it's temperature $T$ to rise.
The temperature $T$ to which it rises is determined by the thermal conductance $G$ which connects the absorber to a thermal bath at temperature $T_b$.
See \cite{richards_bolometers_1994} for an excellent overview of bolometric detectors.

  The rise in temperature is determined by the thermal conductance $G$.

\end{figure*}

A thermometer must be used to measure the temperature $T$.
In a Transition Edge Sensor (\TES) bolometer a thin superconducting film is used as the thermometer.
A superconductor is a material which loses all electrical resistance when it's temperature falls below a critical temperature $T_c$.
This phase transition from the ``normal'' to ``superconducting'' states can be very narrow.
The steepness of the transition is characterized by the logarithmic temperature sensitivity $\alpha$ given by
\begin{equation}
  \alpha = \frac{T_0}{R_0} \frac{\partial R}{\partial T}.
\end{equation}
Typical values of $\alpha$ for \TES\ detectors are 100 -- 1000.
With an appropriately chosen $C$ and absorbing material, a \TES\ sensor can also be used as a calorimeter.

The first demonstration of a \TES\ bolometer was in 1941 \cite{andrews_attenuated_1942}, and the first demonstration using Al (the material used for the detectors in this thesis) was in 1977 \cite{clarke_superconductive_1977}.
But operation of a \TES\ detector requires keeping the temperature of the \TES\ within the narrow transition, which proved challenging.
An increase in the temperature of the \TES\ (which could be caused be either an increase in absorbed optical power for a bolometer or by the absorption of a particle for a calorimeter) causes a rise in the temperature of the \TES.
When current-biased this rise in temperature causes an increase in $I^2 R$ Joule heating, causing the temperature of the detector to rise further, leading to instability.
Thus, \TES\ bolometers did not come into widespread use until the development of the voltage-biased \TES\ sensors \cite{irwin_application_1995} coupled with Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (\SQUID) readout.
When voltage-biased, a rise in \TES\ temperature leads to a decrease in Joule heating, which lowers the temperature of the device.
With a sufficiently steep transition, this electrothermal feedback process allows any change in incident power to be exactly matched by an opposite change in Joule heating, so that the device self-stabilizes in the normal-to-superconducting transition at a constant temperature.
Because the device is voltage-biased, a current amplifier is required for readout.
This is accomplished through the use of \SQUIDs, which are very sensitive magnetometers and so can be used to detect changes in current.

\chapterref{c:tes} covers the theory of \TES\ operation required for understanding of this thesis.
The most detailed and authoritative reference for \TES\ detectors is by Irwin and Hilton \cite{irwin_transition-edge_2005}.

\section{Transition Edge Sensors for Passive Imaging}

The fundamental noise limit in bolometers is set by random thermal fluctuations of the temperature of the absorbing element, termed ``thermal fluctuation noise''.
As described in \sectionref{sec:det-parm-choice}, the noise equivalent power (\NEP) of this noise source, expressed in units of \pnoise\ referred to power absorbed in the bolometer, is proportional to $\sqrt{k_B T_b P_{opt}}$.
In a properly designed \TES, this source of noise will dominate other sources of noise in the system (Johnson noise in the \TES, \SQUID\ noise).
A sufficiently low bath temperature $T_b$ can reduce thermal fluctuation noise to below the noise level caused by fluctuation in the arrival rate of photons through the choice of a sufficiently low $T_b$.
As described in \sectionref{sec:ch5-predicted-noise}, the expected \NETD\ for the \Imager\ populated with 1004 detectors is \SI{38}{\mK}, well below the performance benchmark established in \sectionref{sec:ch1-netd-reqs}.

An important aspect of the advantages of \TES\ detector for passive imaging is the ability to put large numbers of then onto focal planes.
This is due to two factors.
First, they can be fabricated using standard lithographic clean-room techniques, which allows development of array-scale focal planes.
Second, the self-stabilizing behavior of voltage-biased \TES\ detectors is critical for array-scale operation of \TES\ detectors because it greatly relaxes requirement on uniformity across a wafer in the fabrication process.

Reading out a large number of detectors individually requires an even larger number of wires, which complicates cryogenic designs.
An important part of the success of \TES\ detector arrays for millimeter and submillimeter astronomy has been the development of multiplexed \SQUID\ readout systems.
%xx\cite{tdm,berkeley fdm, europe}
The detailed operation of these systems is not described in this thesis.
The \Imager\ uses a time-division multiplexed readout system, the basics of which are described in \sectionref{sec:det-readout}.
